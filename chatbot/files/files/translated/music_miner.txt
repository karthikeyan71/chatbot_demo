Playing programs and combinations
Using controllers to modify the sound You can operate the X50’s [MOD] wheel, [PITCH] wheel, [SW1][SW2], and realtime controllers  to add expressive variation to your performances.
[PITCH] wheel, [MOD] wheel You can use the [PITCH] wheel and [MOD] wheel located at the upper left of the keyboard to  vary the pitch or adjust the depth of modulation. The actual result will depend on the program  and combination, but these controllers are normally used to apply the following effects.
Raise the pitch
Lower the pitch
Deepen the  vibrato
REALTIME CONTROLS [1], [2], [3], [4], [SELECT] Use the [SELECT] button to select realtime controller mode A/B/C, and use knobs [1]–[4] to  control the tone, effects, MIDI control changes, and arpeggiator etc. while you perform. Use  these knobs when you want to modify the sound while performing, or to make simple edits.

4. Turn knob [1] (LPF CUTOFF) to adjust the cutoff frequency of the low pass ﬁlter.
When you adjust the cutoff frequency of the ﬁlter, the brightness of the sound will change.  The effect will depend on the settings of the program parameters, but normally, rotating the  knob toward the left will darken the sound, and rotating it toward the right will brighten it. 5. Turn knob [2] (RESONANCE/HPF) to adjust the resonance level of a low pass ﬁlter or the
cutoff frequency of a high pass ﬁlter. The content that is controlled will depend on the ﬁlter type speciﬁed by the program. By adjusting the ﬁlter resonance level, you can increase or decrease the resonance level to add  a unique character to the sound. Adjusting the cutoff frequency of the high-pass ﬁlter will modify the thickness of the sound  from which the low frequency range has been ﬁltered out.

is applied). Rotating the knob will affect the depth of the ﬁlter EG. Normally, rotating the knob toward  the left will make the ﬁlter EG apply less deeply, and rotating it toward the right will make  the ﬁlter EG apply more deeply. Since the ﬁlter EG will operate based on the cutoff frequency  of the ﬁlter, knobs [1] and [3] will work together to control the tonal changes produced by the  ﬁlter.
7. Turn knob [4] (EG-RELEASE) to adjust EG release times of the ﬁlter and amp. This will
determine the time from note-off until the sound disappears. When you adjust the knob, the release times of the ﬁlter EG and the amp EG will change.  Normally, rotating the knob toward the left will shorten the release time, and rotating it  toward the right will lengthen the release time.

The HI (Hyper Integrated) synthesis system is a  PCM tone generator system with extensive modu- lation and effect routing capabilities, as well as full  digital signal processing that guarantees a rich,  pristine sound.
Tone generator section: • 64 MB of preset PCM ROM containing 470 mul-
tisamples and 518 drumsamples.
• The sampling frequency is 48 kHz, and the
maximum polyphony is 62 voices.
Filter/synthesis section: • 24 dB/oct Low Pass Resonance type or 12 dB/
oct Low Pass & High Pass type ﬁlters can be  used. A wide variety of ﬁlter effects can be  achieved, from active sounds with aggressive  resonance to subtle tones using a high pass ﬁl- ter.
• A broad range of editing parameters gives you
control over every aspect of the sound.
Effect section: • One insert effect (stereo-in/stereo-out), two  master effects (mono-in/stereo-out), and a  three-band master EQ (stereo-in/stereo-out)  can all be used simultaneously. You can select  from 89 types of effect algorithms, and edit  them.
• Highly ﬂexible effect routing is possible. Effects  can also be routed freely to the individual out- puts.
Alternate Modulation and Effect Dynamic  Modulation: • The synthesis section (ﬁlter etc.) provides Alter-
nate Modulation functionality, and the effect  section provides Effect Dynamic Modulation  functionality. This allows you to freely apply  modulation to parameters that affect the pitch,  ﬁlter, amp, EG, LFO, effects etc.
• LFO and delay time parameters can be syn-
chronized to MIDI clock/tempo. You can syn- chronize sounds or effects to the tempo of the  sequencer or the arpeggiator.
A great selection of 512 programs In the Program mode, the X50 provides 512 user  programs, plus 128 programs + 9 drum sets for  GM compatibility. When shipped from the factory, it is loaded with  high-quality programs that cover a wide range of  musical needs.
Programs using multisamples that pro- vide a broad range of sounds Based on 470 different multisamples that deliver a  broad range of sounds ranging from acoustic  instruments such as piano, guitar, and trumpet, to  synthesizer sounds or sound effects (oscillator),  the preset programs provide a rich variety of edit- able parameters (ﬁlter and amp), effects, and  arpeggiators.
Drum programs that support any style  of rhythm part Based on 40 user drum kits and nine GM2-com- patible ROM drum kits, and taking full advantage  of numerous editable parameters, effects, and  arpeggiators, the X50 provides a great selection of  preset programs for any style of music. The drum kits that are the basis of each drum pro- gram allow you to freely map any of the 518 drum  or percussion sounds to each note of the keyboard.  You can also create your own drum kits, and even  specify ﬁlter and amp settings, effect settings, and  individual audio output routings for each separate  key.

X50 Plug-In Editor supports editing  from within your DAW software The “X50 Editor” is a stand-alone program that  lets you edit the X50 from your Macintosh or Win- dows computer.  On the other hand, the “X50 Plug-In Editor” lets  you edit the X50 as a plug-in instrument from  within a host application such as DAW (Digital  Audio Workstation) software. It supports VST,  Audio Units, and RTAS formats. Both editors are  included with your X50.
Introduction
384 different combinations let you  freely combine programs The X50 provides 384 user combinations. The fac- tory settings contain a wide variety of Preloaded  combinations. A combination allows you to use layers, splits, or  velocity switching etc. to combine up to eight pro- grams together with the effects and the two arpeg- giators, in order to create complex sounds that  could not be produced by a program. You can also  create combis that include external tone genera- tors.
Effects that can creatively manipu- late the sound or generate subtle  ambience The X50’s effects can be used in many ways, rang- ing from manipulating the sound dramatically to  creating spacious reverberation. (☞p.9 “High- quality sound featuring the HI synthesis system”)
4 channel audio outputs In addition to the (MAIN OUTPUT) L/MONO  and R main stereo audio outputs, X50 provides  two individual audio outputs, for a total of four  channels of audio output. The sound from each  oscillator, drum, timbre/track, or insert effect can  be routed freely to any output.
Multi mode plays multiple tracks of  data from an external sequencer In Multi mode, the X50 can operate as a 16-track  MIDI multi-timbral sound module, receiving mul- tiple tracks of performance data from an external  sequencer or similar device. Since you can use the  effects and the two arpeggiators as well, the X50  will also function as a more advanced sound mod- ule. You can create, save and recall numerous Multi  sets in the X50 and it also supports GM (General  MIDI System Level 1), making it easy to use as a  sound module for a desktop music system.

About the X50’ modes The X50 has a wide range of capabilities; it lets  you play programs/combinations, edit them, play  the X50’s sound generator using musical perfor- mance data from an external MIDI sequencer, and  make settings that affect the entire X50, such as  transposition and tuning. The largest unit used to  organize these features is called a mode. The X50  has four modes.
Program mode Programs are the basic sounds of X50. In Program  mode, you can: • Select and play Programs • Edit Programs
Make detailed settings for oscillators, ﬁlters,  amps, EGs, LFOs, effects, arpeggiator, etc.
You can use the Tone Adjust function to make  simple edits for the program of a track. Assign Programs to each of the 16 MIDI Tracks,  each with separate volume, pan, EQ, and  keyboard and velocity zones; make settings for  effects, and two Arpeggiator (☞p.69)
Global mode Global mode lets you make overall settings for the  entire X50, and edit arpeggiators and drum kits.  For instance, you can: • Make settings that affect the entire X50, such as
master tune and global MIDI channel
• Create user drum kits, arpeggiators and user
scales
• Rename program, and combination categories • Set the function of the assignable pedals and
assignable switches
• Create drum programs using drum kits (as cre-
• Transmit MIDI System Exclusive data dumps
ated in Global mode)
• Play and control one Arpeggiator (☞p.43)
Combination mode Combinations are sets of up to 8 Programs that  can be played simultaneously, letting you create  sounds more complex than a single Program. In  Combination mode, you can: • Select and play Combinations • Use X50 as a 8-track multitimbral tone genera-
tor
• Edit Combinations
You can use the Tone Adjust function to make  simple edits for the program of a timbre. Assign Programs to each of the 8 Timbres, each  with separate volume, pan, EQ, and keyboard  and velocity zones; make settings for effects,  and Arpeggiator. (☞p.60)
• Control and play up to two Arpeggiator
Multi mode You can use the X50 as a 16-track multi-timbral  sound generator. The X50 will receive GM or other performance  data from an external MIDI sequencer, and play  back this data. • Select and playback Multi sets • Edit Multi sets

The page menu will appear. The page in which you were when you pressed  the [MENU/OK] button will be highlighted as  an indication.
2. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select the
page you want to view.
3. When you’ve made your selection, press the
center of the ClickPoint. You will jump to the selected page, and that  page will appear. As an example here, try selecting “Key Zone.”  The 5: Ed–Key Zone page will appear.
Note: The page that appears will be the page of the  tab you selected most recently. Note: If you set the Global mode setting “Page  Menu Style” to List, you can move by selecting  pages and tabs as shown in the following  illustration. (The display shown in step 2 is for  when “Page Menu Style” = Icon.)
Basic operations After you’ve powered-on the X50, here’s how to  perform basic operations such as selecting modes  and pages.
1. Selecting modes • In order to use a particular function on the X50,
you must ﬁrst select the appropriate mode. Press one of the front panel mode buttons to  enter the corresponding mode. [COMBI] button: Combination mode [PROG] button: Program mode [GLOBAL] button: Global mode [MULTI] button: Multi mode
2. Selecting pages Each mode has a large number of parameters,  which are grouped into pages. These are further  subdivided by tabs into up to eight tab pages. • Make sure that the desired mode is selected.
For details on selecting a mode, see “1.  Selecting modes,” above. In this explanation we’ll use Combination  mode as an example. Press the [COMBI] button.
Note: The COMBI 0: Play page will appear. (This is  shown in the upper left of the display.) In Combination, Program, or Multi modes (i.e., in  other than Global mode), you will normally  perform in this 0: Play page. You can also make  simple adjustments (edits) to the sound while  you’re in this page. To make more detailed  adjustments, use page 1 (COMBI 1: Ed–Tone  Adjust, etc.) and following.
Using the [MENU/OK] button +  [PAGE+][PAGE–] buttons to move • Hold down the [MENU/OK] button and press
the [PAGE+] ([PAGE–] button.
In Combination mode, you will move between  pages in the order of 0: Play ↔ 1: Ed–Tone Adjust  ↔ 2: Ed–Track Parameter ↔ 3: Ed–MIDI Filter1 ↔  ... etc. The page that appears will be the page of  the tab you selected most recently.

numeric buttons [0]–[9] to specify the page  number you want to view. The speciﬁed page number will appear. The  page that appears will be the page of the tab  you selected most recently.
[EXIT/CANCEL] button • You can press the [EXIT/CANCEL] button to
return to page 0 from any page.
Selecting tabs
[PAGE+][PAGE–] buttons You can press these buttons to move forward or  backward in steps of one tab. 1. Press the [PAGE+] button to access the page for
the next (right) tab. (Press [PAGE–] button to  access the page for the previous (left) tab.) This example shows the Combination page  through Prog page of COMBI 0: Play.
2. As you repeatedly press the [PAGE+] button or  [PAGE–] button, you will move consecutively  through the tabs. As you page up past the last  tab of a page, you will then move to the ﬁrst tab  of the next page. Likewise, as you page down  past the ﬁrst tab of a page, you will then move  to the last tab of the preceding page.
3. Selecting a parameter and editing  the value 1. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select the
parameter you want to edit. The value will be highlighted, and the  parameter name is displayed in the upper right  of the display. (We call this the “edit cell.”)
2. To modify the value of the edit cell, use one of
the VALUE controllers ([VALUE] dial,  [INC][DEC] button, numeric buttons [0]–[9], [–]  button, [./HOLD] button, [ENTER] button) or  the ClickPoint. For some parameters, you can use the PROG  BANK buttons to specify the bank of a program  etc. or to specify the parameter value. In some  cases you can also use the musical keyboard to
20
enter a note number or velocity value by  holding down the [ENTER] button and  pressing a note.
Note: You can use the [COMPARE] button to  compare the sound you’re editing with the  original unedited sound.
VALUE controllers
[VALUE] dial Use this dial to edit the selected parameter’s  value. This control is convenient when you want  to scroll through a very long list of selections.
[INC], [DEC] buttons These are used to increase or decrease the parame- ter value by individual steps. They’re convenient  for making ﬁne parameter adjustments.
In Multi mode when the cursor is located at the  track program (highlighted), these buttons switch  the program bank.
[COMPARE] button Use this when you wish to compare the edits you  have made to a program or combination’s sound  with the un-edited original (i.e., the sound that is  written into memory). When editing a program or combination, press  this switch. The LED will light, and the last-writ- ten settings for that program number or combina- tion number will be recalled. When you press the  [COMPARE] button once again, the LED will go  dark and you will return to the settings that you  were editing. If you edit the settings that are recalled by press- ing the [COMPARE] button (i.e., the settings that  are written into memory), the LED will go dark,  and it will not be possible to return to the previous  edits by pressing the [COMPARE] button again.
The Compare function is not available in  Global mode.
Basic operations
4. Selecting and executing a Utility  function
The utility functions provide commands that are  speciﬁc to each page, such Write (save) or Copy.  The available utility functions will depend on the  page you select. For example, the utility functions in Program  mode let you write (save) the settings, or let you  perform convenient editing operations such as  copying settings between oscillators or effects, or a  Sync function that lets you edit two EGs together. 1. Press the [UTILITY] button. The utility menu will appear.
2. Use the ClickPoint [π][†] to select a
command.
3. Press the ClickPoint center.

Note: By holding down the [ENTER] button  and pressing a numeric button [0]–[9] you can  access the dialog box for the ﬁrst ten utility  functions without going through the menu.
4. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select a
parameter in the dialog box.
5. To set the parameter value, use a VALUE
controller (☞p.12) such as the [VALUE] dial,  the ClickPoint (press the center and then use  [π][†]), or [INC][DEC] button. When  selecting a program or combination number in  a dialog box, you can also use the PROG  BANK/COMBI BANK buttons to enter the  bank as an alternative to using the VALUE  controllers.
6. To execute the utility command, press the
[MENU/OK] button. If you decide not to execute, press the [EXIT/ CANCEL] button. The [EXIT/CANCEL]  button is the same as “Cancel,” “Done,” or  “Exit.” The dialog box will close.
• If the utility menu is displayed, press the
[EXIT/CANCEL] button to close the menu.

After you’ve ﬁnished editing, be sure to write  (save) your changes. If you edit a program and then select a  different program or turn off the power, the  changes you made will be lost. The same is  true for a combination or multi set. The settings you edit in Global mode are  remembered as long as the power is on, but  will be lost when you turn off the power.
1. Lower the X50’s [VOLUME] slider.
Also turn the volume of your powered monitor  speakers or stereo amp down to zero.
2. Turn off the power of your powered monitor or
stereo amp.
3. Press the rear panel Power switch to turn off
the power.
Never turn off the power while data is being  written into internal memory. If the power is turned off while processing is  being performed, memory write operations  will not be completed correctly. If this occurs,  X50 will automatically initialize its internal  memory so that it will operate correctly. This  is not a malfunction. While data is being written, the display will  indicate “Now writing into internal memory.”  Data is written into internal memory by the  following operations.
• Writing (updating) a Program, Combination,  Multi, Global Setting, Drum Kit, or Arpeggio  Patterns
• Loading a Preload data for Program, Combina- tion, Multi, Global Setting, Drum Kit, or Arpeg- gio Patterns
• Receiving a MIDI data dump for Program,
If you playback X50 through your stereo  audio system, be aware that high volumes  may damage your speakers. Be careful not to  raise the volume excessively.
Connecting INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT 1 and 2 If desired, you can connect these two individual  (independent) outputs. They are unbalanced  phone output jacks. These jacks allow you to send the X50’s sounds to  external equipment independent of the (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO and R jacks. This can be con- venient when recording, or when using a complex  live performance setup. 1. Connect the (INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT) 1 and 2
jacks to the input jacks of your mixer etc.
Note: The [VOLUME] slider does not affect the  volume of jacks 1 and 2.
Connections
Connections must be made with the power  turned off. Please be aware that careless  operation may damage your speaker system  or cause malfunctions.
Basic connections Connect the audio cables as shown in the connec- tion diagram below.
Connecting audio output devices Here, you can connect a set of ampliﬁed monitor  speakers or your audio system to output X50’s  sound.
Connecting the MAIN OUTPUT L/MONO  and R These are the main outputs. They are unbalanced  phone jacks. These are the main stereo outputs; their volume is  controlled by the [VOLUME] slider. All of the fac- tory Programs and Combis are programmed to  play through these outputs. If you’re editing a program or combination, or  playing back from an external MIDI sequencer in  Multi mode, you can set “BUS Select” to “L/R” so  that the sound will be sent from these jacks. 1.

Connecting a damper pedal This pedal can provide a damper effect as you  play. This instrument also supports half-damping.  Here’s how to connect an optional Korg DS-1H  damper pedal to the DAMPER jack and use it to  control the half-damper effect. 1. Connect an separately sold DS-1H damper
pedal to the DAMPER jack. You’ll be able to control the half-damper effect  if you’ve connected the DS-1H. If you’ve  connected a different switch-type pedal, it will  function as a damper switch.
2. After you turn on the power, set the switch
polarity and adjust the half-damper response to  ensure that the half-damper pedal works  correctly. (☞PG p.77, 80)
2. After turning the power on, use GLOBAL 0:
System, Foot page “Foot Pedal Assign” to  assign the function controlled by the foot pedal.  (☞p.88)

Global mode settings on the X50
Local Control On settings Turn on the Echo Back function of the external  MIDI/USB sequencer or computer (so that data  received at MIDI IN will be re-transmitted from  MIDI OUT/USB), and turn off the X50’s Local  Control setting (so that X50’s keyboard and tone  generator will be internally disconnected). When you play the keyboard of the X50, the musical  data will be transmitted to the external MIDI  sequencer or computer, and then echoed back to  play the X50 tone generator. In other words, by turn- ing Local Control OFF, you can prevent notes from  being sounded in duplicate, as would otherwise  occur if a note were sounded by the X50’s own key- board and again by the data that was echoed-back. If the arpeggiator function is on, playing the X50’s  keyboard will not cause the arpeggiator to oper- ate, and only the musical data produced by play- ing the keyboard will be transmitted. The  arpeggiator will operate only in response to the  notes that are echoed-back and received at MIDI  IN. In this way, turning off Local Control prevents  the arpeggiator from operating in duplicate. Use this setting when you wish to record on the  external MIDI sequencer or computer only the  notes that trigger the arpeggiator, and to use the  echoed-back notes to operate the arpeggiator while  monitoring your recording or during playback. Note: If you want the note data produced by the  arpeggiator to be recorded on the external  sequencer/computer, set Local Control on, and  turn off the Echo Back setting of the external  sequencer/computer. The default setting for Local Control is On. To turn  off Local Control, the “Local Control On” (GLO- BAL 1: MIDI page) check box to uncheck it (☞PG  p.82). When using the X50 by itself, leave Local Control  turned on. (If this is off when X50 is used by itself,  playing the keyboard will not produce sound.) Note: The X50’s Local Control setting can be turned  Off by the Local Control Off message sent from the  editor when you start up X50 Plug-In Editor.

Check this box if the X50 is connected to your  computer and you want to edit the X50 from your  computer (or bi-directionally). You must also  check this box if you’re using the X50 Editor/ Plug-In Editor. By default, the MIDI Filter “Exclu- sive” setting is checked.
The “Convert Position” setting On the X50, the parameters “Key Transpose” and  “Velocity Curve” (GLOBAL 0: System, Basic page)  allow you to transpose the pitch, adjust the veloc- ity sensitivity. The “Convert Position” setting (GLOBAL 1: MIDI  page) speciﬁes the point at which these settings  affect the data from the keyboard and the data  sent or received via MIDI IN/USB or MIDI OUT/ USB. • When controlling an external MIDI tone gener- ator from the X50, select Pre MIDI. The above- listed settings will affect the MIDI data that is  transmitted. Incoming MIDI data will be handled with  settings equivalent to “Key Transpose” 0 and  “Velocity Curve” 4.

Connecting MIDI devices By connecting the X50’s MIDI connectors to an  external MIDI device you can transfer sound set- tings and performance data such as note messages  between your external MIDI device and the X50.
About MIDI MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Inter- face, and is a world-wide standard for exchanging  various types of musical data between electronic  musical instruments and computers. When MIDI  cables are used to connect two or more MIDI  devices, performance data can be exchanged  between the devices, even if they were made by  different manufacturers.
MIDI connectors
MIDI IN: This connector receives MIDI data. Use this to play the X50 from another MIDI  device, or from an external sequencer.
MIDI OUT: This connector transmits MIDI data. Use this to control external MIDI devices, or to  record into an external sequencer.
Controlling an external MIDI tone  generator from X50 When you wish to use the X50’s keyboard, con- trollers, and arpeggiator etc. to play an external  MIDI tone generator, use a MIDI cable to connect  X50’s MIDI OUT connector to the MIDI IN con- nector of the external MIDI tone generator.

Note: This setting applies to selecting Combinations,  as well.
Using MIDI program change mes- sages to select programs By sending MIDI program change messages along  with MIDI bank select messages to the X50 from  an external MIDI device (a MIDI sequencer such  as a DAW program, or a MIDI controller, etc.), you  can select any program in the six banks. You can also install the included “X50 Plug-In Edi- tor” into your DAW program as a plug-in, and  easily select X50 programs or combinations from a  list within your DAW. For more details, see “Edi- tor/Plug-In Editor Manual” (PDF).
MIDI channel setting In order to play the X50 via MIDI, the transmitting  device (MIDI sequencer or computer) and receiv- ing device (the X50) must be set to the matching  MIDI channel. In Program mode, the X50 receives  data on the global MIDI channel. 1. Make sure that the X50 and your external MIDI
device or computer are connected correctly. For details on connections, see p.27.

Using Controllers The X50 provides realtime controllers such as a  [MOD] wheel, pitch bend wheel, and [SW1] [SW2]  switches that let you make your performances  more expressive. These controls let you modify the tone, pitch, vol- ume, effects, etc. in realtime while you play. For example, a piano sound can be played realisti- cally using only the keyboard, but your perfor- mance will be more expressive if you connect a  damper pedal. If you’re playing guitar or wind  instrument sounds, you can use the [PITCH]  wheel to control the pitch or use the [MOD] wheel  to apply vibrato.  Note: In the pages that follow, our explanation will  center on the dedicated functionality of each  controller. However, you can also use these  controllers as sources for “alternate modulation”  or “effect dynamic modulation,” giving you a  much wider range of possible uses than we  describe here. For details on these capabilities, see  “Using Alternate Modulation” (☞p.51) and PG  p.151.
Keyboard
Velocity How hard you play the keyboard affects the expres- siveness of the sound. You can adjust the volume  level setting so that playing the keyboard softly will  produce a soft sound, and playing hard will pro- duce a loud sound. In addition, you can also adjust  the brightness of the sound and the envelope set- tings such as attack rate and release time. Using Velocity Switch in Combination Play mode  and Multi mode, you can play different Programs  by changing the keyboard velocity.  • See PROG 6: Ed–Amp1/2, Mod (☞p.55, PG
p.21) for information on how to change the vol- ume level and envelope using key velocity.

Note: By assigning the Pitch Bend Lock function to  the [SW1] or [SW2], you can lock the applied effect  so that it will be maintained even after the  [PITCH] wheel returns to the center. (☞PG p.172)
Using Controllers
SW1, SW2 By assigning the appropriate functions to the  [SW1] and [SW2] you can use them to transpose  the keyboard in one-octave steps, turn the porta- mento function on/off, or lock the effect of the  [PITCH] wheel. Each button can work as either a Toggle or  Momentary switch. In Toggle mode, the assigned  function is switched between on and off each time  the button is pressed. In Momentary mode, the  assigned function is active on only as long as you  hold down the button. In Program mode you can view the function of the  [SW1] and [SW2] in the 0: Play, Program page; in  Combination mode in the 0: Play, Combination  page; and in Multi mode in the 0: Play, Multi page.

Functions above will always operate as speciﬁed  by the GLOBAL 0: System, Foot page, regardless  of the currently selected program, combination, or  multi set. For more information, see “Specifying the func- tion of the ASSIGNABLE Switch and ASSIGN- ABLE Pedal” (☞p.88).
Sending MIDI information from the  various controllers When you operate a controller of the X50, the cor- responding or speciﬁed control change will be  transmitted via MIDI. Pitch bend messages are  transmitted only when you operate the [PITCH]  wheel. In Program mode, these messages are transmitted  on the global MIDI channel. For details on the MIDI messages transmitted  when you operate an X50 controller, and on the  AMS (Alternate Modulation Source) and DMS  (Dynamic Modulation Source) corresponding to  the MIDI messages, see “MIDI transmission when  the X50/microX’s controllers are operated” (☞PG  p.166).

Using the pedals for control
Damper Pedal (Sustain) The damper pedal is also sometimes called the  sustain pedal. It acts like the similarly-named  pedal on an acoustic piano; when you hold down  the pedal, notes will continue to sustain even  when you lift your hands off of the keyboard.
Damper Switch vs. Half-Damper You can use either a standard footswitch (such as  the Korg PS-1) or a special half-damper pedal  (such as the Korg DS-1H) as the Damper. If you use a footswitch, it will work like a normal  synthesizer sustain pedal: notes will sustain for- ever, as long as the pedal is held down. A half-damper pedal is a special type of continu- ous foot pedal (normal foot pedals won’t work  properly for this application). It offers more subtle  control of sustain, which can be especially useful  for piano sounds.  The X50 will automatically sense when a half- damper is connected to the rear-panel DAMPER  jack. For proper operation, you will also need to  calibrate the pedal, using the “Half Damper Cali- brate” command in the Global page menu. (☞PG  p.77)
Assignable Foot Switch This lets you use a simple footswitch, such as the  Korg PS-1, as an assignable controller. The foot- switch can perform a wide variety of functions,  such as: • Sound and effect modulation • Portamento on/off • Program select up or down • Tap Tempo • Arpeggiator on/off • Duplication of many front panel controls,
including the modulation [MOD] wheel, Real- Time Knobs, [SW1][SW2]
Performance Edit By using the eight sliders of the Performance Edi- tor, you can make overall adjustments to the sound. When you move a slider, multiple program  parameters are adjusted simultaneously, meaning  that you can edit multiple parameters by adjusting  a single slider. 1. In Program mode (PROG 0: Play page), select
the program that you want to edit.
2. Press the [PAGE+] button (or [PAGE–] button)  to access the PROG 0: Play, Perform. Edit page.
3. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select the
performance editor parameter you want to  adjust.
4. Use the [VALUE] dial etc. to adjust the value.
(☞p.20) Note: If you want to reset the value, press  numeric button [0] and then press the [ENTER]  button to restore the previous setting. Octave: Indicates the octave setting. Pitch Stretch: Simultaneously adjusts the  transpose and tune settings of the oscillator.  This allows you to produce a variety of tonal  changes without losing the character of the  original sound. This is particularly effective for acoustic-type  programs such as guitar, bass, or piano. Select  various programs and try this out. OSC Balance: Adjusts the level balance  between oscillators 1 and 2. Note: For programs whose “Mode (Oscillator  Mode)” (PROG 1: Ed–Basic, Prog Basic page)  setting is Single, oscillator 2 will not sound.
Simple program editing
Only the level of oscillator 1 will change. For a  Drums program, this performance editor will  have no effect. Amp Level: Indicates the amp level. This will  adjust the volume of the entire program. Attack Time: Indicates the attack time of the  ﬁlter EG and amp EG. This will adjust the  speed of the attack from note-on. Note: In order to maximize the effect of the  Attack Time adjustment, the amp EG Start  Level, Attack Level, Start Level Modulation,  and Attack Time Modulation parameters are  also adjusted. Decay Time: Indicates the decay time and  slope time of the ﬁlter EG and amp EG. IFX Balance: This simultaneously adjusts the  “W/D (Wet/Dry)” balance of all insert effect. MFX Balance: This simultaneously adjusts the  Return 1 and 2 parameters of the master effects. Note: Depending on the settings of the program  parameters, the result may not be noticeable.
5. If you want to save the modiﬁed sound, select  the utility menu command “Write Program,”  and write the program. (☞p.45)
The edited content will be lost if you select  another program or turn off the power before  saving.
REALTIME CONTROLS [1], [2],  [3], [4], [SELECT] The REALTIME CONTROLS [1]–[4] knobs can be  used to edit parameters such as the ﬁlter cutoff fre- quency, resonance, the amp and ﬁlter EGs, vol- ume, portamento time, pan, LFO speed and more.  Three different modes - A, B, and C - allow each  knob to control one of three separate parameters. 1. Press the REALTIME CONTROLS [SELECT]  button to switch the function of the realtime  controllers to A-mode, B-mode, or C-mode. Each time you press the button, A-mode, B- mode or C-mode will be selected alternately,  and the corresponding LED will light.
Note: If CC#70–79 are assigned to REALTIME  CONTROLS A-mode or B-mode, the sound edited  by knobs [1]–[4] can be saved by the Program  Write operation (☞p.45).

A-mode controls In A-mode, knobs [1]–[4] will control/edit the fol- lowing functions. Note: Placing the knobs in the center (12 o’clock)  position will produce the values speciﬁed by the  program parameters.
Knob [1]: LPF CUTOFF Adjust the cutoff frequency of the low pass ﬁlter. When you adjust the cutoff frequency of the ﬁlter,  the brightness of the sound will change. The effect  will depend on the settings of the program param- eters, but normally, rotating the knob toward the  left will darken the sound, and rotating it toward  the right will brighten it.

Knob [2]: RESONANCE/HPF Adjust the resonance level of a low pass ﬁlter or  the cutoff frequency of a high pass ﬁlter. The content that is controlled will depend on the  ﬁlter type speciﬁed by the program. By adjusting the ﬁlter resonance level, you can  increase or decrease the resonance level to add a  unique character to the sound.

Knob [3]: EG-INTENSITY Adjust the ﬁlter EG intensity (the depth at which  the ﬁlter EG is applied). Rotating the knob will affect the depth of the ﬁlter  EG. Normally, rotating the knob toward the left  will make the ﬁlter EG apply less deeply, and  rotating it toward the right will make the ﬁlter EG  apply more deeply. Since the ﬁlter EG will operate  based on the cutoff frequency of the ﬁlter, knobs  [1] and [3] will work together to control the tonal  changes produced by the ﬁlter.

Knob [4]: EG-RELEASE Adjust the EG release times of the ﬁlter and amp.  This will determine the time from note-off until  the sound disappears. When you adjust the knob, the release times of the  ﬁlter EG and the amp EG will change. Normally,  rotating the knob toward the left will shorten the  release time, and rotating it toward the right will  lengthen the release time.

You can create your own original sounds by edit- ing the factory Programs, or by initializing a Pro- gram (Bank D 127: Init. Program) and starting  from scratch. You can save these Programs into  any bank other than Bank G or g(d), which cannot  be modiﬁed.
Before you begin editing
The three attributes of sound: pitch,  tone, and volume Sound has three basic attributes; pitch, tone, and  volume. To control these attributes, the X50 provides  “oscillator,” “ﬁlter,” and “amp (ampliﬁer)” sec- tions. The “oscillator” settings vary the pitch, the “ﬁlter”  settings modify the tone, and the “amp” settings  modify the volume.
The X50’s “oscillator,” “ﬁlter,” and “amp” On the X50, the settings that determine the “pitch”  are located in the PROG 1: Ed–Basic and PROG 2:  Ed–Pitch pages. In the Ed–Basic page you can  specify the waveform (multisample) and the basic  pitch of the waveform. In the Ed–Pitch page you  can specify how the pitch will follow the key- board, and make other pitch-related settings. “Filter” settings are made in the PROG 4: Ed– Filter1 and PROG 5: Ed–Filter2 pages. These set- tings adjust the tone. Finally, “Amp” settings are made in the PROG 6:  Ed–Amp1/2 pages. These settings adjust the vol- ume, and send the sound to the outputs.

These three sections determine the basic sound of  the program.
EG, LFO, keyboard tracking, AMS,  Dmod, controllers In addition to the sections described above, the  X50 provides ways in which the sound can be var- ied according to time, key range, or various types  of performance expression. These are controlled  by modulators and controllers such as EG (enve- lope generator), LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator),  keyboard tracking, AMS (Alternate Modulation  Source), Dmod (Dynamic modulation), the  [PITCH] and [MOD] wheels. You can use these  modulators and controllers to apply change to the  basic sound of the program. Take a look at the diagram entitled “Program  structure and corresponding pages.” Notice that  the audio signal ﬂows in the order of Oscillator/ Pitch → Filter → Amp. Also notice how modula- tors such as EG and LFO can affect these blocks. As shown in ﬁgure, a program consists of OSC 1/ 2, effects, and the arpeggiator.
OSC 1/2 Each timbre consists of Oscillator/Pitch, Filter,  Amp, EG, and LFO blocks. You can create more  complex programs by using two oscillators  together in one program using the Layer feature. Note: The Pitch EG is shared by OSC1 and OSC2.
EFFECTS The output of OSC 1/2 is sent to the insert effect,  the master effects, and the master EQ. The mixer  section lets you control the routing, so you can  specify where the sound will be sent.

Basic oscillator settings
Comparing (original and edited  sounds) When you’re in the process of editing a sound,  pressing the [COMPARE] button will recall the  saved version of the sound, as it was before you  started editing. To indicate that you are listening  to the saved version, the button’s LED will light  up. Pressing [COMPARE] button again returns you to  the version you are editing, and the LED will go  out again. If you edit while the COMPARE LED is lit, the  button will again go dark and your previous edits  will be lost.
Basic oscillator settings
Program type setting (single, dou- ble, drum kit) Here you can specify the type of program  (whether to use one oscillator, two oscillators, or a  drum kit). Use the PROG 1: Ed–Basic, Prog Basic  “Oscillator Mode” to specify the program type.
Single Programs have one oscillator, and Double  Programs have two oscillators. Each oscillator  includes a complete synthesis voice, with velocity- switched Multisamples, dual ﬁlters, EGs, LFOs,  and so on.  Drums mode is a special variation of Single mode,  and uses a Drum Kit (as created in Global mode)  instead of Multisamples.
Polyphony Polyphony is the number of notes that can be  played simultaneously, such as in a chord. The  polyphony depends on the program type.

When this is set to Poly, you can play both chords  and melody lines. When this is set to Mono, only  one note will sound even if you play a chord. Normally you’ll set this to Poly, but Mono is use- ful when playing sounds such as synth basses,  synth leads, and other solo instruments. Another  important aspect of monophonic playing is Legato  triggering. When Legato is on (the box is checked),  if a new note on the keyboard is played before the  previous note is released, the ﬁlter and ampliﬁer  EGs will not re-trigger, so that you can move from  note to note in a true legato fashion. If the previ- ous note is released before the next note is played,  the note will trigger normally. Try switching between Poly and Mono, and listen  to the results.
Working with Multisamples
What is a multisample? A sample is a digital recording of a particular  instrument or waveform (or other natural or artiﬁ- cially processed sound) recorded at a speciﬁc  pitch. A multisample is a collection of similarly  voiced samples, used to create the same type of  sound - piano, bass, guitar, strings, organ - across  the entire keyboard, as the basis of a program. The  oscillators of single and double programs use mul- tisamples. There are 470 multisamples available in  this instrument. You can assign up to two multisamples to each  oscillator and switch between them by velocity.  This is called “velocity multisample switching.”
Multisamples and Drum Kits Multisamples and Drum Kits allow you to play  samples in different ways. • Multisamples lay out one or more samples
across the keyboard. For instance, a very simple  guitar Multisample might have six samples– one for each string.
• As the name suggests, Drum Kits are optimized
for playing drum samples.
48
Selecting Multisamples If you specify a High and Low multisample for an  oscillator, either the High or the Low multisample  will sound depending on the velocity of the note  (i.e., the strength at which you play the keyboard).  This function is called velocity multisample  switching. Note: To make it easier for you to hear the result,  set the program type to “Oscillator Mode” Single. 1. Access the PROG 1: Ed–Basic, OSC1 page. 2. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to highlight
“High Multisample.”
• Use the [VALUE] dial or the numeric buttons  and [ENTER] button to make your selection.
• Alternatively, you can select a multisample by
category. With “High Multisample” highlighted, press  the [CATEGORY] button to access the category  menu. (☞p.38)
Use the [PAGE+][PAGE–] buttons to select a  category. Then use the [VALUE] dial to select a  multisample. Press the [MENU/OK] button to ﬁnalize your  selection.
3. Specify the basic pitch of the oscillator. This is
set by the “Octave” parameter.
4. In the same way, select a different multisample
for “Low Multisample.” You have now assigned the “High” and “Low”  multisamples. Next we’ll set the velocity range.
Note: If you do not wish to use this function, set  the “Velocity SW L → H” value to 001. Only the  High multisample will sound.
Reverse check box Reverse lets you play the selected multisample  backwards, without looping. This can produce  interesting results for sound effects or other  unusual timbres. Normally you will not check  this.
Using oscillators 1 and 2 to create a  detuned sound You can use a double program (i.e., a program  whose “Oscillator Mode” is Double) to create a  detuned sound as follows. 1. Make the same multisample and EG settings,
etc. for OSC1 and OSC2. It will be convenient to use the Utility “Copy  Oscillator” to make the oscillator settings  match each other.
2. Specify the playback pitch for OSC1 and OSC2.
The playback pitch can be set independently.  By using the same multisample with slightly  different “Tune” settings, you can “detune” the  oscillators to produce a richer sound. Generally  speaking, people hear ﬂat notes as sounding  “sour” or out of tune more easily than they do  sharp notes. So when detuning two oscillators,  it may sound more musical to tune one  oscillator up in pitch, and leave the other  oscillator close to or just slightly below normal  pitch.
Basic oscillator settings
“Velocity SW L→H” to 32 and “OSC2” to 96.  The settings are shown as vertical lines in the  velocity zone display. In this example, the multisamples will sound  over four levels. Velocity values 001–031: sound only the OSC1 Low multisample. Velocity values 032–063: sound only the OSC1 High multisample. Velocity values 064–095: sound the OSC1 High multisample and the  OSC2 Low multisample. Velocity values 096–127: sound the OSC1 High multisample and the  OSC2 High multisample.
Copying settings between OSC1 &  OSC2 Many of the Program parameters can be set differ- ently for OSC1 and OSC2. These include all of the parameters on: • All of the tabs on the Ed–Pitch page, except for
the Pitch EG
• All of the tabs on the Ed–Filter page • All of the tabs on the Ed–Amp page • All of the tabs on the Ed–LFOs page You can use the utility menu’s Copy Oscillator  command to copy these parameters from one  Oscillator to another. You can even copy parame- ters from an Oscillator in a different Program. This command is useful when you want to set  both Oscillators to the same settings, or when you  want to duplicate settings you’ve used before.
Using velocity to switch between oscil- lator 1 and 2
Assigning a drum kit
Here you can specify the range of velocities that  will sound oscillators 1 and 2. In the example shown above, the velocity ranges  are as follows. • OSC1 will sound for all velocity values. • OSC2 will sound only for strongly played notes
(64 and above).
• You can use Velocity Multisample Switching in
addition to this (☞“High Multisample, Low  Multisample”). For this example, set “OSC1” in
What is a drum kit? If you want to use a drum kit in a program, set the  “Oscillator Mode” to Drums. Then choose one of  the 40 user drum kits or nine GM-compatible  drum kits for the program to use. A drum program uses a “drum kit” for its oscilla- tor. A drum kit consists of multiple drum instru- ment samples placed across the keyboard. There  are 518 drum instrument samples. (☞p.48 “Multi- samples and Drum Kits”) In Global mode you can create or edit a drum kit  itself. You can assign up to two drum samples  (High and Low) to each note of the keyboard, and  switch between these drum samples by velocity.  You can also specify the effects and the routing to  49

5. Specify the basic pitch of the oscillator. For a
drum kit, set “Octave” to +0 [8'].
Using LFOs and Envelopes (EGs)
Using LFOs Each Oscillator has two LFOs: LFO1 and LFO2. You can use these LFOs to modulate many differ- ent Program parameters, including: • Pitch (vibrato): PROG 2: Ed–Pitch, OSC1 LFO
“Intensity,” and the same parameter of the  OSC2 LFO
• Filter (wah effect): PROG 4: Ed–Filter1, LFO
Mod. “Intensity to A” and “to B,” and the same  parameters for PROG 5: Ed–Filter2
• Volume (auto-tremolo): PROG 6: Ed–Amp1/2,
Mod, LFO1 Mod. “Intensity,” and the same  parameters for LFO2 Mod.
In addition to the uses described above, you can  use an LFO as a source for Alternate Modulation  and Effect Dynamic Modulation to modulate a  wide range of parameters. By assigning an LFO to  “Pan AMS” (PROG 6: Ed–Amp1/2, Level/Pan)  you can create an auto-pan effect.
50
Basic LFO settings Note: Depending on the program you’ve selected,  you may be unable to hear the result of the  following edits. If so, increase the value of one of  the “Intensity” parameters listed above so that  you can hear the result. For example in order to use OSC1 LFO1 to modu- late ﬁlter 1, you should increase the PROG 4: Ed– Filter1, LFO Mod. LFO1 “Intensity to A” or “Inten- sity to B” value. 1. Access the PROG 3: Ed–LFOs, OSC1 LFO page.
2. Select the “Waveform” parameter. 3. Use the [VALUE] dial etc. to select the desired
LFO waveform. The display shows a graphic of the waveform. There are a number of waveforms to choose  from. Each are suited to different applications: Triangle and Sine are the classic LFO shapes  for vibrato, tremolo, panning, and ﬁlter wah  effects. Square is useful for gated ﬁlter and amp  effects, and creates a police siren effect when  modulating pitch. The Guitar waveform is designed especially for  guitar vibrato, since it bends only upwards  from the base value. Saw and Exponential Saw Down are good for  rhythmic ﬁlter and amp effects. Random 1 (S/H) creates the classic sample-and- hold effect, which is great for modulating a  resonant ﬁlter.
4. After looking at the different waveforms, select
Triangle.
5. Use the “Frequency” parameter to set the speed
of the LFO.
6. Use the “Fade” and “Dly” (Delay) settings to
EGs (Envelope Generators) An envelope creates a modulation signal by mov- ing from one level to another over a speciﬁed time,  and then moving to another level over another  period of time, and so on.  Each program includes three EGs, one for Pitch,  one for the Filter, and one for the Amp. These pro- duce time-varying changes in pitch, tone, and vol- ume respectively. They can also be used to  modulate a number of other Program parameters  via AMS.

Using Alternate Modulation AMS (Alternate Modulation Source) refers to any  of the assignable modulation sources in X50,  including: • Built-in physical controllers, such as the
[PITCH] wheel, [MOD] wheel, and Real-Time  Knobs
• Incoming MIDI controllers • Modulators such as the Filter, Pitch, and Amp
EGs, or the LFOs
Using Alternate Modulation
Intensity is a parameter that sets the degree  (speed, depth, amount etc.) to which AMS will  control the modulation. A number of frequently-used modulation rout- ings, such as using the [PITCH] wheel to vary the  pitch, are provided as additional, dedicated rout- ings, separate from AMS. Note that not all AMS sources may be available for  some modulation destinations.  For details on alternate modulation and AMS, see  “Alternate Modulation Source (AMS)” (☞PG  p.151).
Suggestions on using AMS When making settings for alternate modulation,  think of the effect that you wish to produce, what  type of modulation will be necessary to produce  that effect, and what parameter of the oscillator,  ﬁlter, or ampliﬁer needs to be controlled.  Next, select a source (AMS) and set the Intensity.  If you proceed logically in this way, you will  achieve the desired effect. For example, if you want to control a guitar sound  so that it approaches feedback when you move the  [MOD] wheel, you might set up the [MOD] wheel  to modulate the ﬁlter frequency and resonance.
Controlling Pitch Here you can specify how the pitch of the multi- sample selected for the oscillator will change.  Pitch EG and LFO settings allow the pitch to var- ied over time. Note: To specify the basic pitch of the multisample,  use the “Octave” parameter in the PROG 1: Ed– Basic, OSC1 or OSC2 page.
Varying the pitch according to key- board position (Pitch Slope) On keyboard instruments such as piano or organ,  the pitch will rise as you play toward the right  side of the keyboard, and fall as you play toward  the left. You can use the “Pitch Slope” setting to specify  how this will occur. With positive (+) settings, the pitch will rise as you  play toward the right side of the keyboard. With  negative (–) settings, the pitch will fall as you play  toward the right side of the keyboard.  Normally you will leave this set to +1.0.

Pitch bend The PBend+ and PBend– settings specify the  amount of pitch change (in semitones) that will  occur when MIDI pitch bend messages are  received or when the [PITCH] wheel. A setting of  +12 allows the pitch to be controlled a maximum  of one octave upward; a setting of –12 allows the  pitch to be controlled a maximum of one octave  downward. “Ribbon (#16)” speciﬁes the amount of pitch  change (in units of a semitone) that will occur  when CC#16 is received (or when you operate the  ribbon controller of a connected TRITON Extreme  or similar device).
Portamento Portamento makes the pitch change smoothly  when you play the next note before releasing the  previous note. The “Time” parameter controls how long it take  the pitch to change. As this value is increased, the  pitch will change over a longer time. With a value  of 000, there will be no portamento. You can turn Portamento on and off via [SW1] or  [SW2], by assigning them to Porta.SW CC#65.
Creating Vibrato You can use an LFO to create vibrato. LFO 1/2 Intensity sets the depth to which the  selected LFO will affect the pitch. With a setting of  +12.00, vibrato will produce a maximum of ±1  octave of pitch change. “Mod. Whl. Int.” speciﬁes the depth of the vibrato  effect created by the LFO when you move the  [MOD] wheel or when CC#1 is received. “AMS Intensity” speciﬁes the depth of the vibrato  effect created by LFO when you operate an AMS  (Alternate Modulation Source). For example, sup- pose you set “LFO1 AMS” to KnobM1 [+] (Knob  Mod1: CC#17), and raise the “AMS Intensity.” If  Knob B Assign “Knob 1-B” is set to Knob Mod.1  (CC#17), vibrato will be applied when you turn  the X50’s knob [1] or when CC#17 is received.
52
Pitch EG When the Intensity value is set to +12.00, the pitch  EG speciﬁed in the Pitch EG page will produce a  maximum of ±1 octave of pitch change. To realistically simulate the slight change in pitch  that occurs when a string is plucked or at the  attack of a brass or vocal sound, you can use the  EG to create a subtle change in pitch at the attack.
Using Filters The ﬁlters allows you to diminish or emphasize  speciﬁed frequency areas of the sound. The tone of the sound will depend signiﬁcantly  on the ﬁlter settings. X50 provides Filter1 for OSC1 and Filter2 for  OSC2. For each of these ﬁlters, you can select from  two types (Low Pass Resonance or Low Pass &  High Pass). Filter2 can be used if “Mode (Oscilla- tor Mode)” is set to Double.

When this is set to 0, there is no emphasis, and fre- quencies beyond the cutoff will simply diminish  smoothly.
Using Filters
At medium settings, the resonance will alter the  timbre of the ﬁlter, making it sound more nasal, or  more extreme. At very high settings, the resonance  can be heard as a separate, whistling pitch. To make the resonance track the keyboard pitch,  see “4–2a: Keyboard Track” (☞PG p.17).
Selecting a ﬁlter to modify the tone Here’s how to select a ﬁlter type and adjust the  “Frequency” (cutoff frequency) and “Resonance”  (resonance level). 1. Use “Type” to select a ﬁlter type.
Low Pass Resonance: This is a 24 dB/octave  low pass ﬁlter with resonance. Low Pass & High Pass: This is a 12 dB/octave  low pass ﬁlter and a 12 dB/octave high pass  ﬁlter connected in series.
2. If you’ve selected Low Pass Resonance as the
ﬁlter type, you can set the parameters for Filter  A. “Frequency” speciﬁes the cutoff frequency.  Overtones above the speciﬁed cutoff frequency  will be diminished, making the tone more  mellow (darker). “Resonance” speciﬁes the resonance level. This  boosts the overtones in the region of the  speciﬁed “Frequency,” giving the sound a  distinctive character.
If you’ve selected Low Pass & High Pass as the  ﬁlter type, you can use the Filter A parameters  to adjust the low pass ﬁlter and the Filter B  parameters to adjust the high pass ﬁlter. Overtones above the Filter A “Frequency” will  be diminished, making the sound more mellow  (darker). Overtones below the Filter B “Frequency” will  be diminished, decreasing the low-range and  making the sound thinner.

Keyboard Track Most acoustic instruments get brighter as you play  higher pitches. At its most basic, keyboard track- ing re-creates this effect by increasing the cutoff  frequency of a lowpass ﬁlter as you play higher on  the keyboard. Usually, some amount of key track- ing is necessary in order to make the timbre con- sistent across the entire range. • When Ramp “Low” is set to a positive (+)
value, the cutoff frequency will rise as you play  lower on the keyboard, making the sound  brighter. When set to a negative (–) value, the  cutoff frequency will fall as you play lower on  the keyboard, making the sound darker.
• When Ramp “High” is set to a positive (+)
value, the cutoff frequency will rise as you play  higher on the keyboard, making the sound  brighter. When set to a negative (–) value, the  cutoff frequency will fall as you play higher on  the keyboard, making the sound darker.
• “Int. to A” and “Int. to B” adjust the effect that  keyboard tracking will have on ﬁlters A and B.
For more details, see “4–2a: Keyboard Track”  (☞PG p.17).
Filter EG The Filter EG is a multi-stage envelope, which you  can use to modulate the ﬁlter (naturally!) as well  as other Program parameters. The EG itself is set  up on the Filter page; the way that it affects the ﬁl- ters is controlled by the parameters described  below, on the Filter Mod page: The “Int. to A” and “Int. to B” settings control the  basic amount of EG modulation for ﬁlter frequen- cies A and B, respectively, before other modula- tion. The “Vel to A” and “Vel to B” settings let you use  velocity to scale the amount of EG modulation. The “AMS” setting selects a AMS modulation  source to scale the amount of the Filter EG applied  to Filters A and B. The two ﬁlters share a single  AMS source, with separate intensity settings.

Setting the basic amp level The basic volume level is set by the “Amp Level”  parameter. You can then alter this using the modulation  sources below:
Applying modulation to the amp
Keyboard Track This lets you vary the volume relative to the note  you play. For more details, see “Keyboard Track” (☞p.54).
Using the Amp section
Velocity (Amp Modulation) Velocity Intensity is used by most programs to  decrease the volume of softly played notes and  increase the volume of strongly played notes. Normally you will set Amp Modulation to posi- tive (+) values. As this setting is increased, there  will be greater volume difference between softly  played and strongly played notes.
LFO1/2 Mod. Speciﬁes how the LFO’s will produce cyclic  changes in volume (tremolo effect). The volume will be affected by the LFO(s) for  which you set an LFO1 Mod Intensity, LFO2 Mod  Intensity value. Intensity (AMS Intensity) adjusts the depth by  which the tremolo effect produced by the LFO will  be affected when you assign an AMS (LFO1 AMS,  LFO2 AMS).  For example if you set “AMS” (LFO1 or LFO2) to  JS-Y #02, receive CC#2 to apply a tremolo effect.
Amp EG (Amp Envelope Generator) The Amp EG lets you control how the volume  changes over the course of a note.
Every instrument has its own characteristic vol- ume envelope. This is part of what gives each  instrument its identiﬁable character.  Conversely, by changing the volume contour–for  instance, applying a string-like Amp EG curve to  an organ multisample– you can produce interest- ing and unusual sounds.

Master Effects You can make master effect settings in the PROG  9: Ed–MasterFX page. There are two Master Effects, which are accessed  through Sends 1 and 2. These are best-suited to  effects such as reverbs and delays, but you can use  them with any type of effect. (☞p.85)
Master EQ You can make master EQ settings in the PROG 9:  Ed–MasterFX page. The master EQ is located immediately before the  (MAIN OUTPUT) L/MONO and R outputs. Use it  to adjust the overall tone. (☞p.85)
Playing and Editing Programs
Adjusting the pan (stereo position)
The main “Pan” parameter determines the place- ment of the sound in the stereo ﬁeld after the sig- nal has passed through the oscillator, ﬁlter, and  amp.  Normally you’ll set this to C064, so that the sound  is centered equally between the left and right  speakers.  To create a stereo effect when “Oscillator Mode” is  set to Double, set the Amp1 “Pan” to L001, and  the Amp2 “Pan” R127. This will make OSC1 go to  the left speaker, and OSC2 go to the right speaker. With a setting of Random, the pan will change  randomly each time you play a note on X50, pro- ducing an interesting effect.
Pan AMS and Intensity “Intensity” speciﬁes the depth of the pan modula- tion from the selected AMS source. If you set AMS to Note Number, the pan will  change according to the keyboard position of each  note played. With a setting of LFO1 or 2, the sound will sweep  from side to side, creating an auto-pan effect.

Playing and Editing Combinations
What’s a Combination? Combinations, or “Combis” for short, let you split  and layer up to 8 Programs at once.  A Combi is made up of 8 Timbres. Each Timbre  has a Program, along with parameters for key and  velocity zones, mixer settings, MIDI channel and
controller ﬁltering, and so on. As with Programs, each Combi has 1 Insert Effect,  2 Master Effects, and a Master EQ, for shaping and  transforming the sounds of the individual Tim- bres. Finally, Combis can use 2 Arpeggio patterns  modules at once.
Playing combinations
Selecting combinations There are several different ways to select Combi- nations. Each one is convenient in a different way: • Selecting combinations from the front panel:
Using “Combi Select” to select a program · Turn the [VALUE] dial. · Use the [INC][DEC] buttons. · Use numeric buttons [0]–[9] to enter the pro-
gram number, and press the [ENTER] but- ton.
· Press the center of the ClickPoint to high- light the ﬁeld, then use [π][†] to select a  program, and press the center to ﬁnalize  your selection.
· Use the COMBI BANK [A]–[C] buttons to
select a combination bank.
· Using 10’s HOLD to select combinations
(☞p.39)
Selecting combinations by program category You can select programs by categories such as  piano or drums. · Using “Select by Category” to select by cate-
gory (☞p.38)
· Using Cat. HOLD to select a category
(☞p.38)
• Selecting combinations by using a foot-
switch: You can change combinations even while both  hands are busy playing on the keyboard -  convenient for live applications
• Selecting combinations by receiving MIDI
program changes: You can switch combinations from an external  MIDI sequencer or an external MIDI controller.
See below for details.
Selecting combinations from the  front panel 1. Press a [COMBI] button. (The button will light.) You will enter Combination mode. Notice that  the upper line of the display indicates “COMBI  0: Play” (mode name, page number and name).

for  preloaded  combination
With the factory settings,  these banks contain a wide  variety of preloaded  combinations that use  multiple programs, effects,  and arpeggio patterns. 128 programs can be written  or rewritten to each bank A–C  (for a total of 384). You can’t  write (save) data in these  banks.
Selecting by Category You can select Combinations from within a cate- gory, such as keyboard, synthesizer, bass, and  drums. When shipped from the factory, the preloaded  Combinations are organized into 16 categories. For details on how to select combinations in this  way, see the following page. ☞p.38 “Selecting programs by category” ☞p.38 “Using Cat.HOLD to select by category”
58
Using 10’s HOLD to select combina- tions You can ﬁx the ten’s place of the combination  number as you select combinations. For details on how to do this, refer to “Using 10’s  HOLD to select programs” (☞p.39).
Using a footswitch to select Combi- nations You can assign a footswitch to step through Com- binations one by one, either going up (0, 1, 2, 3,  etc.) or going down (3, 2, 1 etc.). This lets you change Combinations without using  your hands–great for quick Combination changes  in live performance situations. For details on how to do this, refer to “Using a  footswitch to select Programs” (☞p.39).
Using MIDI program changes to  select combinations You can select combinations in the COMBI 0: Play  page or switch the programs of timbres by send- ing MIDI program change messages from your  external MIDI device (DAW software or other  sequencer, or MIDI controller) to the X50. If you’ve installed the included “X50 Plug-In Edi- tor” into your DAW program as a plug-in, you can  easily select X50 programs or combinations from a  list within your DAW software. For more details,  see “Editor/Plug-In Editor Manual” (PDF).

Using Controllers
Using Controllers Just as in Program mode, you can use controllers  such as the [MOD] wheel, pitch bend wheel,  [SW1][SW2], and REALTIME CONTROLS [1]–[4]  to add a broad range of expression to your playing  in Combination mode. These controls let you modify the tone, pitch, vol- ume, effects, etc. in realtime while you play. For more details, see “Using Controllers” (☞p.59).
You can edit any of the Combinations shipped  with X50, or you can start with an initialized Pro- gram to create sounds from scratch. On the X50, you can use the edit of COMBI 0: Play  page and the realtime controller knobs and  switches of the front panel to make simple  changes to a program without having to enter the  editing pages that contain the detailed editing  parameters.
Changing the programs  within the Combination Changing the Program assigned to each timbre (1– 8) is a quick way to dramatically alter the sound of  the Combination. Note: You can make the following settings from  either the COMBI 0: Play page or the 1: Ed–Tone  Adjust page.
Selecting programs from the front  panel and LCD To change the Program assigned to a Timbre: 1. Access the COMBI 0: Play, Prog page.
This page shows information about the  programs assigned to Timbres 1–8.
2. Use the ClickPoint to highlight “Program
Select,” and use the [VALUE] dial etc. to select a  program. You can use either of the following methods to  select a program.
• “Selecting programs from the front panel:”
(☞p.37)
• When selecting by category, “Selecting pro-
grams by category” will be the only available  method. (☞p.38 “Selecting programs by cate- gory”)
Listening to the program sound of just  one timbre Here’s how you can listen to the sound of a single  timbre by itself. 1. Press the [UTILITY] button to access the utility
menu.
2. Use the ClickPoint [π][†] to choose “Solo  Selected Timbre,” and press the ClickPoint  center. Now you will hear only the program sound of  the currently selected timbre. The lower part of  the display will indicate [Solo].
3. To cancel this setting, choose “Solo Selected  Timbre” once again and press the ClickPoint  center.
Receiving MIDI program changes to  switch timbre programs See “Switching the program of a timbre via MIDI”  (☞p.58). Note: MIDI program changes only work for  Timbres whose Status is set to INT.
Adjusting a timbre’s pan and  volume

Before you begin editing A combination has eight timbres. Each timbre con- sists of a program with parameters such as key- board zone, velocity zone, mixer settings, MIDI  channel, and ﬁlter. See the diagram entitled “Com- bination structure and corresponding pages.”
Overview of Combi mode parame- ters
Select a program for each timbre In the COMBI 0: Play, Prog page (or COMBI 1: Ed– Tone Adjust, Prog page), select a program for each  timbre.
Status and MIDI settings In the COMBI 2: Ed–Track Param, MIDI page, set  “Status” to INT for the timbres that you want to  play, and set their MIDI channel to the global  MIDI channel.
Combination structure and corresponding pages
Layer, split, and velocity switch In the COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Key page and the  6: Vel Zone, Vel page, specify the range (layer,  split, velocity switching, etc.) in which each pro- gram will sound.
Adjust the programs so that they ﬁt  within the combination For each timbre program, specify the poly/mono  setting and adjust timbre parameters such as por- tamento and transpose.
Effects The output of each timbre is sent to the insert  effect, the master effects, and the master EQ. You  can use the mixer section to freely specify how the  audio signals will be routed. There is one insert effect and two master effects,  and for each of these you can choose one of 89  effect types. The master EQ is a stereo three-band  EQ. Note: The effect settings created and saved with a  program in Program mode are not used in  Combination mode. Effect settings are made  independently for the combination.
Arpeggiator A combination can use two arpeggiators (dual  polyphonic arpeggiators). You can select the  arpeggio pattern, specify the range in which the  arpeggio is generated, and specify the region of  notes (keys) or velocities that will trigger the  arpeggiator.

Selecting a program for each timbre
Selecting a program for each  timbre You can select a program for each timbre in the  COMBI 0: Play, Prog page or in the COMBI 1: Ed– Tone Adjust, Prog page. For the procedure, see “Changing the programs  within the Combination” (☞p.60)
Status and MIDI settings
“Status” and MIDI channel
Status This controls the status of MIDI and the internal  tone generator for each Timbre. Normally, if  you’re playing an internal Program, this should be  set to INT.  If the status is set to Off, EXT, or EX2, that internal  sounds will not be played. Off simply disables the  Timbre entirely. The EXT and EX2 settings allow  the Timbre to control an external MIDI device.
Bank Select (when status=EX2) When the Status is set to EX2, these parameters  allow you to transmit MIDI Bank Select messages  for changing banks on external MIDI devices.
MIDI Channel Timbres that you wish to play from X50’s key- board must be set to the global MIDI channel.  Your playing on the keyboard is transmitted on  the global MIDI channel, and will sound any tim- bre that matches this channel. Normally you will  set this to Gch. When this is set to Gch, the MIDI  channel of the timbre will always match the global  MIDI channel, even if you change the global MIDI  channel.
If a check box is checked, the corresponding MIDI  data can be sent and received. If “Status” is INT,  movements of the X50’s controllers or incoming  MIDI data will apply an effect for the program of  that timbre. (Effect Dynamic Modulation function- ality is not affected by these settings.) If the “Sta- tus” is EXT or EX2, movements of the X50’s  controllers will transmit MIDI data on the channel  of that timbre. MIDI transmit/receive settings for  the entire X50 are made in “MIDI Filter” (GLO- BAL 1). If a check box is unchecked, the corresponding  MIDI data will not be sent or received. As another example, let’s say that you’ve selected  a bass Program for Timbre 1, and a piano Program  for Timbre 2, with the goal of creating a bass/ piano split. You could make the following settings  so that pressing the damper pedal affects only  Timbre 2’s piano sound: 1. Access the COMBI 3: Ed–MIDI Filter1, -2 page. 2. Un-check the Damper CC#64 box for Timbre 1. 3. Check the Damper CC#64 box for Timbre 2.

Layers, Splits, and Velocity  switches Within a Combination, you can use note number  and velocity to determine which Timbres will  sound. The Programs assigned to each Timbre can sound  in three ways: as part of a layer, a split, or a veloc- ity switch. A Combination can be set to use any  one of these methods, or to use two or more of  these methods simultaneously.
Layer Layers cause two or more Programs to sound  simultaneously when a note is played.
Program A Program B
Layer:  Two or more programs sound  simultaneously.
Split Splits cause different Programs to sound on differ- ent areas of the keyboard.
Program A
Program B
Split:  Different programs will sound in  different areas of the keyboard.
Velocity Switch Velocity Switches cause different Programs to  sound depending on the velocity (how hard you  play the notes).
Program B Program A
Keyboard playing dynamics
Strong Soft Velocity Switch: Keyboard playing dynamics  (velocity) switches between  different programs.
On X50, you can use a different Program for each  of up to eight Timbres, and combine two or more  of the above methods to create even more complex  setups.

Keyboard X-Fade (keyboard  crossfade):  As you play from low notes to  high notes, the volume of A  will fade out, and the volume  of B will fade in.
3. Access the COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Slope page. 4. Next, if you set the “Bottom Slope” of timbre 1  to 12, and set the “Top Slope” of timbre 2 to 12,  the sound will change gradually instead of  changing suddenly.
Creating Key Splits and Layers Let’s create a Combi which combines both splits  and layers, like the diagram below:
Timbre 1 Timbre 2
Timbre 3
Brass
Strings
Piano
C–1
B3
C4
G9
1. Access the COMBI 0: Play, Prog page. 2. Select a piano sound for Timbre 1, a brass
sound for Timbre 2, and a strings sound for  Timbre 3.
3. Access the COMBI 2: Ed–Timbre Param, MIDI
page.
4. For Timbres 1–3, set Status to INT and MIDI
Channel to Gch (the Global Channel).
5. Access the COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Key page. 6. Set Timbre 1’s Top Key to G9, and its Bottom
Key to C4.
7. Set Timbres 2 and 3 to a Top Key of B3, and a
Bottom Key of C–1. You can also enter these values by selecting the  parameter, and then holding down the  [ENTER] button and playing a note on the  keyboard. The piano program will sound when you play a  key above or including C4. The brass program  and strings program will sound when you play  a key below C4.
Key Zone Slope In addition to “hard” splits, in which the sound  changes abruptly, you can use the “Slope” param- eters to gradually fade a sound in or out over a  range of keys. We’ll assume that you are continuing to edit from  the preceding example. 1. Access the COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Key page. 2. In the example above, you could set the
“Bottom Key” of timbre 1 to G3, and set the  “Top Key” of timbre 2 to G4, so that these two  timbres overlap.
5. The COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Review page
shows a graphic indication of the region of keys  (or note data) for which timbres 1–8 will play.  The region that will sound is shown as a line,  and the shaded area indicates the portion  occupied by the slope.
Creating Velocity Switches Next, let’s create a simple velocity switched Com- bination, like the diagram below:
Timbre 1
Timbre 2
Brass
Strings
127 64 63 1
Velocity  switch
1. Access the COMBI 0: Play, Prog page. 2. Select a brass sound for Timbre 1, and a strings
sound for Timbre 2.
3. Access the COMBI 2: Ed–Timbre Param, MIDI
page.
4. For Timbres 1–2, set “Status” to INT and MIDI
Channel to Gch (the Global Channel).
5. Access the COMBI 6: Ed–Vel Zone, Vel page. 6. Set Timbre 1’s Top Velocity to 127, and its
Bottom Velocity to 64.
7. Set Timbre 2 to a Top Velocity of 63, and a
the velocity zones of the two Timbres so that  they partially overlap.
3. Access the COMBI 6: Ed–Vel Zone, Slope page. 4. Then, set the “Top Slope” and “Bottom Slope”  so that the sound changes gradually, instead of  changing suddenly between velocity values of  63 and 64.
5. The COMBI 6: Ed–Vel Zone, Review page  shows a graphic indication of the region of  velocities for which timbres 1–8 will play. The  region that will sound is shown as a line, and  the shaded area indicates the portion occupied  by the slope.

Altering Programs to ﬁt  within a Combination You can make various changes to Programs within  the context of a particular Combination, to make  them ﬁt better with other Programs, or to create  particular sonic effects. These changes do not  affect the original Programs, or how those Pro- grams sound in other Combinations.
Specifying how the timbre will  sound
You can make these settings in COMBI 2: Ed–Tim- bre Param, OSC.
Force OSC Mode Normally this should be set to PRG, so that the  sound will play as set by the original Program.  If you wish to force a polyphonic program to  sound monophonically, set this either to Mono or  LGT (Legato). Conversely, set this to Poly if you  wish to force a monophonic program to play poly- phonically.

Altering Programs to fit within a Combination
Adjusting the pitch
Delay and scale settings
You can make these settings in COMBI 2: Ed–Tim- bre Param, Pitch.
You can make these settings in COMBI 2: Ed–Tim- bre Param, Other.
Transpose, Detune (BPM Adjust) These parameters adjust the pitch of the timbre. • In a layer-type combination, you can set two or  more timbres to the same program, and create a  richer sound by using “Transpose” to shift their  pitch apart by an octave or by using “Detune”  to create a slight difference in pitch between the  two.
• In split-type combinations, you can use “Trans-
pose” to shift the pitch (in semitone units) of  the programs speciﬁed for each key zone.
• If you wish to change the playback pitch of a  drum program, use “Detune.” If you change  the “Transpose” setting, the relationship  between notes and drum sounds will change.
Adjusting the BPM of multisamples If you’re using a phrase or rhythm loop multisam- ple in the program of a timbre, you can adjust its  BPM. You can use the utility menu “Detune BPM  Adjust” to call up a new BPM value. This changes  the BPM by adjusting the playback pitch.  For more details, see “Detune BPM Adjust” (☞PG  p.41).
Specifying the range of pitch change  controlled by the [PITCH] wheel This is speciﬁed by the “Bend Range.” You can  specify the range in semitone units. With the PRG  setting, the pitch bend range will be as speciﬁed  by the program.
Delay You can set some Timbres so that they don’t sound  immediately at note-on. This can create cool  effects, and more dramatic layers.  You can specify the delay for each Timbre either in  milliseconds (ms), or in rhythmic values which  sync to the system tempo. If you set the “Delay” to Key Off, the Timbre will  sound when the note is released.
Use Program’s Scale This speciﬁes the scale for each timbre. If you check “Use Program’s Scale,” the scale  speciﬁed by the program will be used. Timbres for  which this is not checked will use the Scale setting  “Type (Combi scale).”
Editing Programs with Tone Adjust Using Tone Adjust, you can make detailed edits to  Programs within the context of the Combi. You  can assign six parameters to each timbre and  adjust them, but you can also re-specify parame- ters and make further adjustments. Proceed as follows. 1. Of the COMBI 1: Ed–Tone Adjust, TA1–TA3  pages, access the page that you want to edit.
2. For each timbre, use “Destination 1–6” to select
the parameter that you want to adjust for the  program.
3. Use the [VALUE] dial etc. to adjust the value of
the parameter you selected in “Destination 1– 6.” The sound will change accordingly.
Effects Effects are covered in their own section of the  manuals, so we won’t go into too much detail  here. (☞p.79)
Insert Effect You can make settings for the insert effect in the  COMBI 8: Ed–InsertFX page. The output of each timbre can be sent to the insert  effect. You can use any type of effects, from distor- tions and compressors to choruses and reverbs. The Insert Effect can be routed to the main out- puts, or to any of the individual outputs. (☞p.84)
Master Effects You can make master effect settings in the COMBI  9: Ed–MasterFX page. There are two Master Effects, which are accessed  through Sends 1 and 2. These are best-suited to  effects such as reverbs and delays, but you can use  them with any type of effect. (☞p.85)
MIDI considerations
In Multi mode you will normally switch programs  and control the volume and pan etc. by sending  MIDI messages from your MIDI sequencer or  DAW software, but in this section of the manual  we’ll explain how to make these settings from the  X50 itself. However, making these settings in the  X50 does not automatically make these settings a  part of the sequence itself. These settings can be transferred to your MIDI  sequencer by sending a data dump from the X50  (if your MIDI sequencer can receive exclusive  messages) or by using the included “X50 Plug-In  Editor” software to read this data from the X50.  Then you can send these settings from your  sequencer back to the X50 when needed.
Selecting a multi set
Selecting multi sets from the front  panel 1. Press a [MULTI] button. (The button will light.)
You will enter Multi mode. Notice that the  upper line of the display indicates “MULTI 0:  Play” (mode name, page number and name).
The “Multi Mode” setting This setting is located in GLOBAL 0: System, Pref- erence page, “Multi Mode,” and you can change it  to suit the way in which you’re using the X50. for Ext-Seq: Choose this if you’re using the X50 as  a multi-timbral sound module. When you switch  multi sets on the X50, program changes and other  MIDI messages will not be transmitted even by  tracks whose “Status” is EXT or BTH. for Master: Choose this if you’re using the X50 as  a master keyboard. In this case when you switch  multi sets on the X50, program changes and other  MIDI messages will be transmitted from tracks  whose “Status” is EXT or BTH, allowing you to set  up your external sound module in this way.

Checking the sound of a track
Playing the X50’s keyboard to hear the  sound 1. Use the “Control Track” setting to choose the  track that will respond to the X50’s keyboard.
If “Status” (☞p.71 ““Status” and MIDI  channel”) is INT or BTH, you can play the  X50’s keyboard and operate its controllers to
70
hear the X50’s internal tone generator with the  settings (program and level etc.) of the track  you speciﬁed as the “Control Track.” Any other  tracks that have a matching MIDI channel will  also sound at this time. If the “Status” of the  track is EXT, EX2, or BTH, the corresponding  MIDI messages will be transmitted on the MIDI  channel that is speciﬁed for that track.
Receiving MIDI data from an external  sequencer to play the X50 By default, the X50’s tracks 1 through 16 are set to  MIDI channels 1 through 16, with track 1 receiving  channel 1, track 2 receiving channel 2, and so on. 1. To hear the track (1) whose “MIDI Channel”  setting is 1, transmit performance data (MIDI  note-on/off messages) from your external  MIDI sequencer on MIDI channel 1. If the “Status” is INT or BTH, the X50’s tone  generator will sound. If the “Status” is Off,  EXT, or EX2, the X50’s tone generator will not  sound.
Silencing a speciﬁc track (Mute) The X50 provides a Mute function that lets you  temporarily silence the desired track(s) 1–16. For  example, you can use this to listen only to the  rhythm section while you record a new track. You  can also use this function to modify the structure  of the song. 1. Access the MULTI 0: Play, Program page. 2. Select the “PLAY/MUTE” and press the
This page shows the pan and volume settings  for the programs assigned to tracks 1–16.
2. Use the ClickPoint to highlight the “Pan” of the
track whose pan setting you want to adjust,  and use the [VALUE] dial etc. to adjust the  setting. A setting of C064 is center, L001 is far left, and  R127 is far right. With a setting of RND, the  stereo location will change randomly between  left and right each time a note is played.
Adjusting the volume Here’s how to adjust the volume of each track. 1. Access the MULTI 0: Play, Mixer page. 2. Use the ClickPoint to highlight the “Volume” of
the track whose volume setting you want to  adjust, and use the [VALUE] dial etc. to adjust  the setting.
“Status” and MIDI channel
Status This speciﬁes the MIDI status of the internal tone  generator for each track. If you want the X50’s internal tone generator to  sound, choose the INT or BTH setting. These set- tings let you use your external MIDI sequencer to  play the X50 as a multi-track sound module. The  BTH setting lets you control an external MIDI  device at the same time that you play the internal  tone generator. Choose the Off setting for tracks you’re not using.  With the Off, EXT, or EX2 settings, the internal  tone generator will not sound. With the BTH, EXT, or EX2 settings, you can play  an external sound module on the MIDI channel of  the “Control Track.”
MIDI data is transmitted and received on the  MIDI channel that is speciﬁed separately for each  track by “MIDI Channel.” Data from Arp.

Bank select (when Status = EX2) If the “Status” is EX2, the LSB value and MSB  value of the “Bank Select MSB/LSB” will be  enabled, and the bank number you specify here  will be transmitted via MIDI.
MIDI channel This speciﬁes the MIDI channel that the track uses  to send and receive note data. If multiple tracks  are set to the same MIDI channel, and their “Sta- tus” is set to INT, they will all sound and be con- trolled in the same way when they receive MIDI  data. The “Control Track” setting speciﬁes the track that  is played by the X50’s keyboard and controlled by  its controllers. Data on the “MIDI Channel” of the  “Control Track” will play the X50’s internal tone  generator according its track settings (program,  level, etc.) if the track’s “Status” is INT or BTH,  and will also play any other tracks on the same  MIDI channel whose “Status” is INT or BTH. If the  “Status” is EXT, EX2, or BTH, these messages will  be transmitted on the MIDI channel speciﬁed by  the track.
MIDI ﬁlter settings Each MIDI ﬁlter item speciﬁes whether the corre- sponding MIDI message will be transmitted and  received. The message can be transmitted and  received if the check box is checked. (☞p.64  “MIDI ﬁlter settings”)

Using and Editing Multi sets
Copying the settings of a  combination to a multi set You can copy the settings of a combination to a  multi set. If you have a favorite combination, this  function provides a convenient way to copy those  sounds to the tracks of a multi set. Note: Set the global MIDI channel (GLOBAL 1:  MIDI, “MIDI Channel”) to 01. 1. Select a multi set. (☞p.69 “Selecting a multi
set”)
2. Choose the “Copy From Combi” utility.
A dialog box will appear.
3. Use the “Combi” ﬁeld to select the combination
that you want to copy.
4. If you also want the effect settings of the
combination to be copied, check the “With  Effects” check box.
5. Specify the tracks of the multi set to which you  want the eight timbres of the combination to be  copied. If you want to copy the settings of the  combination to tracks 1–8, choose “Track 1 to  8.” If you want to copy them to tracks 9–16,  choose “Track 9 to 16.”
6. If you want the sound of the combination
including its arpeggiator performance to be  recorded on your external MIDI sequencer in  order to reproduce the same sounds as when  you were recording, you should check the  “Auto adjust Arpeggio setting” check box. This will make adjustments to the MIDI  channel and other settings of some tracks, and  add tracks as necessary to ensure that the  arpeggio performance will be reproduced. Depending on the settings of the combination,  you may need to make additional changes to  the track settings. Note: This is available if you’ve selected “Track  1 to 8.” In order to use the “Auto adjust  Arpeggio setting” function, the combination  you’re copying must have already been written  with its [ARP ON/OFF] button turned on.
7. Press the [MENU/OK] button to execute the

Altering Programs to ﬁt  within a Multi set You can make adjustments to the sound of the pro- gram for each track, for example by changing the  way it plays or by adjusting its pitch or scale. You can make various changes to Programs within  the context of a particular Multi set, to make them  ﬁt better with other Programs, or to create particu- lar sonic effects. These changes do not affect the  original Programs, or how those Programs sound  in other Multi sets. It is the same as for a Combina- tion. For more details, see “Altering Programs to  ﬁt within a Combination” (☞p.66).
Using and Editing Multi sets
There is one insert effect and two master effects,  and for each of these you can choose one of 89  effect types. The master EQ is a stereo three-band  EQ. The effect settings created and saved with a pro- gram in Program mode are not used in Multi  mode. Effect settings are made independently for  the Multi set.
Arpeggiator A multi set can use two arpeggiators (dual poly- phonic arpeggiators). You can select the arpeggio  pattern, specify the range in which the arpeggio is  generated, and specify the region of notes (keys)  or velocities that will trigger the arpeggiator.

Selecting a multi set You can switch multi sets via MIDI by sending  MIDI Song Select messages. A song select message  will be transmitted when you switch multi sets.  Conversely, you can switch multi sets by receiving  a song select message from the source you specify.  If the Global “Multi Mode” is set to “for Master,”  switching the multi set number will cause each  track with a “Status” of EXT, EX2 or BTH to trans- mit bank select, program change, volume, pan,  portamento, send 1 and 2, post-IFX pan, and post- IFX send 1 and 2 messages on the channel speci- ﬁed for that track.
Switching the program assigned to a  track via MIDI • Receiving MIDI program change messages to
select programs: (☞p.39 “Using MIDI program  change messages to select programs”) Note: In order to select programs via MIDI  program changes, the track’s “Status” must be  set to INT.
The MIDI channel of a track is speciﬁed by MULTI  2: Track Param, MIDI “MIDI Channel.” When a  program change is received on a MIDI channel  that matches the channel setting of a track, the  program will change if the “Status” of that track is  INT. However, program changes for a track will  also depend on the “Program Change” setting. The “Status” setting is located in the MULTI 2:  Track Param, MIDI page, and the “Program  Change” setting is in the MULTI 3: MIDI Filter1, -1  page. If you’ve installed the included “X50 Plug-In Edi- tor” control plug-in into your DAW software, you  can conveniently select the X50 programs from a  list within your DAW. For more details, see “Edi- tor/Plug-In Editor Manual” (PDF).

Effects in each mode
Program mode In Program mode, the insert effect can be used as  part of the sound-creating process, in the same  way that the output sound of the oscillator (OSC)  is processed by the ﬁlter and amp to create the  ﬁnal sound. Then the master effects can be used to  apply spatial-type effects such as reverb. The ste- reo 3-band master EQ located immediately before  the (MAIN OUTPUT) L/MONO and R outputs is  used to make ﬁnal adjustments in tone. These set- tings can be made independently for each pro- gram. PROG 8: Ed–InsertFX • Select the BUS and master effect send level for
the oscillator output.
• Insert Effect routing, selection and settings.  PROG 9: Ed–MasterFX • Master Effect selection and settings. • Master EQ settings.

Combination mode, Multi mode In Combination mode, and Multi mode, the  insert effect can be applied to each timbre/track.  The master effects are used to apply overall spa- tial processing, and the master EQ is used to make  overall adjustments in tone. These settings are made in Combination mode  independently for each combination, and in Multi  mode for each multi set the entire mode.

Here we will describe some representative effects  in each category.
Filter and dynamics control effects Equalizers (07: St.Para.4EQ–08: St.Graphic7EQ)  divide the frequency range into several bands, and  allow you to boost or cut the level of each band.  Normally they are used to correct or compensate  the sound, but they can also be used to simulate  the frequency response that is typical of a particu- lar instrument (such as the resonances of a guitar  or string instrument). Compressors (02: St.Compressor) compress the  dynamic range of the input signal. Compression  makes the sound punchier and more consistent.  This is particularly effective on guitar, piano, or  drum sounds.

Pitch/phase modulation effects Chorus effects (16: St.Chorus–19: St.Ensemble, 26:  St.BiphaseMod) are an effective way to add spa- ciousness and thickness to any type of sound.  These are ideally suited for use with electric  pianos, strings, guitars, and so on. In an ensemble,  pitch variations between instruments create a rich,  slightly warbling sound. Essentially, this gives the  impression that a number of musicians are playing  together. The chorus effect simulates this. In stereo  performance, the stereo image is widened, thus  creating a magniﬁcent spatial ambience.  Flanger effects (20: St.Flanger–22: St.Env.Flanger)  add unique characteristics to a sound. Although  similar to chorus, a ﬂanger uses a shorter delay  time and feeds some of the output signal back into  the effect, creating a strong swell. Flangers work  very well on sounds that contain a lot of harmon- ics, as well as on distorted guitar sounds. Phasers (23: St.Phaser–25: St.Env.Phaser) cyclically  modulate the phase of the sound. They are similar  to the chorus and ﬂanger effects in that both use  modulation, but the manner in which the tonal  quality changes is different. They are effective  with electric piano, guitars, and synth sounds with  a reasonable sustain.
Other modulation and pitch shift  effects Rotary speaker effect (40: Rotary SP) simulates the  rotating speaker effect used in organs. It is ideal  for use with organ sounds, but it will also create a  unique effect with other sounds.  Pitch shifters (38: Pitch Shifter, 39: PitchShift Mod)  shift the pitch of the input signal. You can mix the  pitch-shifted sound with the original sound to cre- ate a chorus effect, or create special effects in  which the pitch continues to rise (or fall).
80
Early reﬂection and delay effects Early reﬂection effect (41: Early Reﬂect) produces  only the early reﬂections of a reverb effect. Using  just these early reﬂections, you can add weight or  spatial effects to a sound, such as reverberation.  Without the reverberation, you can achieve a clean  effect sound. Delays (43: LCR Delay–51: Sequence Dly) create  an echo effect by delaying the sound for a ﬁxed  length of time. You can also make the delayed  sound repeat (feed back).

Reverb effects Reverb (52: Rev Hall–57: Rev Brt. Room) is an effect  that creates the spacious reverberation of sounds  played in a hall or room. Reverb simulates the  sounds that are reﬂected from the ceiling and wall. When you hear music in a concert hall, the sound  from the instruments and voices reaches your ear  directly, but also reaches your ear after being  reﬂected off the ceiling and walls (and being  delayed by a corresponding length of time). In this  way, the direct sound (the “dry” sound) is joined  by numerous reﬂections that create the impression  of a large acoustical space. The way in which the  sound is reﬂected will depend on the materials of  the ceiling and walls, and also on the size and  shape of the hall. These factors also affect the way  in which the reverberation decays. Different effect  types let you simulate a broad range of reverbera- tion, and you can also edit the parameters to make  detailed changes to the character of the sound.

Off: The sound will not be sent to (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO, R, (INDIVIDUAL  OUTPUT) 1 and 2. After passing through the  master effects, the sound is sent to the MAIN  OUTPUT. Choose this setting if you want to  send the sound in series through the master  effects at the send level speciﬁed by “MFX  Send.” (See diagram below)
Effect settings for a program
Routing The structure of the insert effect, master effects,  and master EQ is the same in each mode. How- ever, the routing will determine how the oscillator  output of the program is sent to the insert effect  and the master effects. As an example, here’s how  to specify the routing and make effect settings in  Program mode. 1. Access the PROG 8: Ed–InsertFX, BUS page. 2. Set “BUS Select (All OSCs)” to specify where
the oscillator output will be sent. L/R: The output will be sent to (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO and R. (See diagram  below) Note: After passing through the master EQ, the  sound will be sent to (MAIN OUTPUT) L/ MONO and R.

For details on the parameters of each effect, see PG  p.104–.
Master EQ 1. Use the stereo 3-band master EQ to make ﬁnal  equalizing adjustments immediately before the  sound is output from the (MAIN OUTPUT) L/ MONO and R jacks. Set the Low, Mid, and High gain in the PROG 9:  Ed–MasterFX, Setup page. Low and High are  shelving-type, and Mid is a peaking-type  adjustment. These settings are linked with the  Low, Mid, and High “Gain” settings of the  Master EQ page. In addition to these settings,  the Master EQ page also lets you specify the  center frequency and bandwidth (Mid only) of  each band, and make settings for dynamic  modulation.

Routing In Combination and Multi modes, you can specify  the routing of each timbre/track to the insert effect  and master effects. These settings are made in the  same way in each of these modes. We will be using  the example of Combination mode in our explana- tion here. 1. Access the COMBI 8: Ed–InsertFX, BUS page.
2. In “BUS Select,” specify where the output of  each timbre will be sent. (See diagram below) L/R: The output will be sent to (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO and R. Note: After passing through the master EQ, the  sound will be sent to (MAIN OUTPUT) L/ MONO and R. IFX: The output will be sent to insert effect IFX.  1, 2, 1/2: The output will be sent to  (INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT) 1 or 2. Note: It will not be sent to the insert effect, the  master effects, or the master EQ. Off: The sound will not be sent to (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO, R, (INDIVIDUAL  OUTPUT) 1 and 2. After passing through the  master effects, the sound is sent to the MAIN
OUTPUT. Choose this setting if you want to  send the sound in series through the master  effects at the send level speciﬁed by “MFX  Send.” (See diagram below)
3. “S1” (Send1(MFX1)), “S2” (Send2(MFX2))
speciﬁes the send level from each timbre to the  master effects. This can be set only if “BUS Select” is set to L/R  or Off. The actual send level will be the send level of  each timbre multiplied by the send level of each  oscillator of the program selected for the  timbre. If the send level of a program is 0, the  actual level will be zero even if the send level  setting is raised here. If IFX is selected for “BUS Select,” set the send  levels to the master effects by adjusting the “S1  (Send1(MFX1))” and “S2 (Send2(MFX2))”  parameters (COMBI 8: Ed–InsertFX, Setup  page) located after the signal has passed  through the insert effect.

Specifying the MIDI channel that will  control effects
Insert effect You can specify the MIDI channel that will control  the insert effect dynamic modulation (Dmod) and  the “Pan” (CC#8), “Send 1 (MFX1),” and “Send 2  (MFX2)” settings that follow the insert effect. An asterisk “*” is shown at the right of Ch01–16  for the channel numbers of timbres that are routed  to IFX. If multiple timbres/tracks of different  MIDI channels are routed to IFX, set the “Control  Channel” to specify the channel you’ll use to con- trol the effect. For a combination, you will normally use the Gch  (global MIDI channel) to control the effect. For a multi set, you can use any MIDI channel that  is convenient. “All Rt.” stands for All Routed, indicating that  you can control the effect using the channel of any  timbre/track that is routed.
Master effects You can specify the MIDI channel that will control  dynamic modulation (Dmod) for the master effects. For a combination, you will normally use the Gch  (global MIDI channel) to control the effects. For a multi set, you can use any MIDI channel that  is convenient.
Dynamic modulation and BPM/MIDI Sync.
Dynamic modulation and  BPM/MIDI Sync. Dynamic modulation (Dmod) is a function that  lets you use MIDI messages or the X50’s control- lers to control speciﬁc effect parameters in real- time. BPM/MIDI Sync. is another function that controls  effect parameters, and is used to synchronize the  LFO speed of modulation-type effects or the delay  time etc. of delay-type effects to the tempo of the  arpeggiator or an external sequencer.
Using dynamic modulation to con- trol effects in realtime These examples show how you can use dynamic  modulation to control an effect parameter in real- time. 1. As described in the procedure for “Effect
settings for a program” (☞p.81), set “IFX” to  49: LCR BPM Delay. Verify that a delay sound  is being output. Then continue on to set the items described  below.
Moving the [MOD] wheel to vary the  delay level via Dmod 1. Access the PROG 8: Ed–InsertFX, IFX page. 2. Set “InLvl Mod” to +100. 3. Set “Src” to M.Whl#1.
The [MOD] wheel will control the input level to  the effect. If this is set to M.Whl#1, moving the [MOD]  wheel up will gradually increase the level of  the delayed signal.
Using the Dmod function and [SW1] to  vary the feedback level 1. In the PROG 7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Controls page,
set the function of “SW1” to SW1 Mod.  (CC#80), Toggle.

3. Set “(Amount)” to +30.
4. (Move the [MOD] wheel.) Press the [SW1]; the
feedback level will increase, and the delay  sound will continue for an extended time. The “(Amount)” setting determines the  feedback level when the [SW1] is pressed. If  you set “(Amount)” to –10 and press the [SW1],  the feedback level will be 0.
Using the BPM/MIDI Sync. function  to synchronize the delay time to  arpeggiator tempo changes. The BPM/MIDI Sync. function lets you synchro- nize the delay time to the tempo of the arpeggio. 1. In the PROG 8: Ed–InsertFX, IFX page, set
“BPM” to MIDI.
2. For L, C, and R, set “L/C/R Bs” and “Times” as
desired.
For this example, set “L/C/R Bs” to (cid:1) and
“Times” to 1 so that the effect will be easily  understandable. The delay time will repeat at  an interval of a 8th note.
3. Set the realtime controller function to C-mode,
and rotate REALTIME CONTROLS knob [4]  (“TEMPO”). (Move the [MOD] wheel.) Operate the knob;  the delay time will change.
4. Turn on the [ARP ON/OFF] button to start the
arpeggiator. Select an arpeggio pattern as desired. (Move the [MOD] wheel.) When you rotate  REALTIME CONTROLS knob [4], the delay
86
time will change in synchronization to any  changes you make in the arpeggiator tempo.
If you rotate the REALTIME CONTROLS  knob [4] to change the tempo while the delay  is sounding, noise may occur in the delay  sound. This is because the delay sound  becomes discontinuous, and is not a  malfunction. For some effects, you can synchronize the  LFO frequency to the tempo. Set the effect  parameters “BPM/MIDI Sync” to On, and  “BPM” to MIDI. For details see PG p.160.
Saving edited effect settings Effect parameters that you edit in Program mode  are saved when you write the program. Similarly,  effect parameters that you edit in Combination  mode or Multi mode are saved when you write  the combination or multi set. (☞p.45, 61, 75)
Bypassing the insert effect or  the master effects Normally, you will switch the effects on/off indi- vidually for each program, combination, or multi  set. However, you also have the option of bypass- ing the insert effect or master effects for the entire  X50 if you don’t want to use them. For example, this can be useful when you’re using  an outboard effect such as reverb, chorus, or com- pressor to create an effect that you would other- wise create using the X50’s master effects, or when  you’re using a plug-in effect on your computer to  process the sound of the X50 together with other  sound sources. 1. Press the [GLOBAL] button to enter Global
mode.
2. Access the GLOBAL 0: System, Basic page.

Tuning to another instrument/Trans- posing “Master Tune” adjusts the overall pitch. Edit this  setting when you are playing the X50 with other  instruments, or when playing along with music on  CD or tape. You can adjust the pitch in a range of  ±50 cents (one semitone = 100 cents). If this is at 0,  middle A is tuned to 440 Hz. “Key Transpose” shifts the pitch in semitone steps.  Edit this setting when you want to transpose the  sound of the entire X50. You can adjust the trans- position in a range of ±1 octave.
Adjusting the way in which velocity  will affect the volume or tone You can adjust the way in which changes in veloc- ity will affect the volume or tone by selecting dif- ferent velocity curves. Each curve has its own  character, so you can select the curve that is appro- priate for your own playing dynamics, playing  style, and the effect that you wish to obtain. (☞PG  p.76) “Velocity Curve” selects the velocity curve.
Bypassing the effects If the FX SW “IFX Off,” “MFX1 Off,” and “MFX2  Off” boxes are checked, the insert effect, master  effect 1, and master effect 2 will respectively be  bypassed. This applies to the entire X50 regardless  of the mode. For example, if you’ve connected the  X50’s outputs to an external mixer and are using  an external effect processor to apply reverb or cho- rus to the sound, you can turn off the X50’s master  effects.

Creating user scales    2: User Scale
Creating an original scale, and  assigning it to a Program On the User Scale page, you can create your own  original scales. These include sixteen different  User Octave Scales, in which the pitch of each note  of the octave is repeated for all octaves, and one  User All Note Scale, in which the pitch of each of  the 128 notes can be speciﬁed independently. By adjusting the pitch of each key in the range of  ±99 cents, you can raise or lower it by approxi- mately one semitone relative to the normal pitch. The user scales you create here can be used by  specifying the scale for a program, for each timbre  of a combination, or for each track of a Multi set. You can choose these scales from the following  pages.

Arpeggiator features in  Program mode
The chord you play on  the keyboard is sounded  as an arpeggio  (individual notes)
In addition to this, the X50’s arpeggiator is a poly- phonic arpeggiator that is able to produce a vari- ety of chordal transformations or phrases based on  the pitch or timing of the notes you play on the  keyboard. These functions let you use the arpeg- giator to play a wide range of patterns including  drum or bass phrases, and guitar or keyboard  backing riffs. It is also effective to use the arpeg- giator as part of the sound-creating process when  creating subtly-moving pads, synth-sounds, or  sound effects. In Program mode you can use one arpeggiator. In Combination mode and Multi mode, the X50  features a Dual Polyphonic Arpeggiator that lets  you simultaneously use two arpeggio patterns.  You can take advantage of this in many ways,  such as applying separate arpeggio patterns to a  drum program and a bass program, or using key- board zones or velocity splits to switch between  two arpeggio patterns.

Adjusting the level of the arpeggiated  notes (ARP-VELOCITY) 1. Press the REALTIME CONTROLS [SELECT]
button to make the right “C” LED light.
2. Rotate the [2] (ARP-VELOCITY) knob to adjust  the strength (or level) of the arpeggiated notes. Rotating the knob toward the left will make the  notes weaker, and rotating the knob toward the  right will make the notes stronger. At the center  position (12 o’clock), the velocity will be as  speciﬁed by the program parameter “Velocity”  (7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Setup page). Note: You can control the tone effectively by  simultaneously adjusting the REALTIME  CONTROLS A-mode [1] (LPF CUTOFF), [2]  (RESONANCE/HPF), and [3] (EG- INTENSITY) knobs.
Changing the length of the arpeggio  pattern (ARP-LENGTH) 1. Press the REALTIME CONTROLS [SELECT]
button to make the right “C” LED light.
2. Turn the [3] (ARP-LENGTH) knob to change
the length of the arpeggio pattern. At the center position (12 o’clock), the length  will be the same as the arpeggiator’s “Lgth  (Length)” setting (7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Setup  page). Turn the knob toward the left to shorten  the pattern, or toward the right to lengthen the  pattern. The arpeggio pattern will play  repeatedly for the number of times speciﬁed by  LENGTH. Changing this value will change the  character of the pattern. Note: This has no effect for the preset patterns  (UP, DOWN, ALT1, ALT2, RANDOM).
The way in which the pattern is played will  depend on settings such as “Octave” and “Sort.”  Preset-0–Preset-4 in the following diagrams show  how the arpeggio will be played when “Octave” is  set to 1, and “Sort” is checked. Preset-4: RAN- DOM is one possibility. Preset-0: UP

Note: If a user arpeggio pattern is selected, the  “Octave Motion” setting (GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern,  Setup page) will affect the way in which the  arpeggio is played.
Selecting the playback order of the  arpeggiated notes (Sort) “Sort” is different than selecting the arpeggiator  pattern. “Sort” speciﬁes whether the notes of the  arpeggio will be sounded in order of their pitch  (regardless of the order in which they were  played) or in the order in which you played them. • Use the ClickPoint to select the “Sort” check
box, and press the center. Checked: the arpeggio will sound each note in  the order of its pitch, regardless of the order in  which you actually played the notes. Unchecked: the arpeggio will sound each note  in the order in which you actually played the  notes.

check box, and press the center. Checked: When you take your hands  completely off of the keyboard, the arpeggio  pattern will immediately start over from the  beginning in sync with the ﬁrst key you press.  This setting is suitable when you want the  arpeggio to start from the beginning of the  measure as you are playing in realtime. Unchecked: The arpeggio will always be  synchronized to the MIDI clock tempo.
Selecting whether to hear the arpeggi- ated notes, the notes you physically  play on the keyboard, or both. (Key- board) • Use the ClickPoint to select the “Keyboard”
check box, and press the center. Checked: The notes you play on the keyboard  and the notes played by the arpeggiator will  both sound. Unchecked: Only the arpeggiated notes will  sound.
Setting the velocity of the arpeggiated  notes (Velocity) “Velocity” lets you specify the velocity of the  arpeggiated notes. If this is set to Key, the velocity  with which you actually played the note will be  used. If a user arpeggio pattern is selected, you  can set this to Step. In this case, the value of the  “Vel(Velocity)” setting for each step (GLOBAL 5:  Arp.Pattern, Edit page) will be used. Note: This value will be in effect when the  REALTIME CONTROLS C-mode [ARP- VELOCITY] knob is in the center position (12  o’clock). Be sure that the knob is in the center  position when you make this setting. Note: When a preload user arpeggio pattern is  selected, setting the “Gate” or “Velocity” to Step  will add a sense of groove to the arpeggio pattern.
Making the arpeggio pattern “shufﬂe”  (Swing) “Swing” modiﬁes the timing of the even-num- bered arpeggiated notes, letting you give a “shuf- ﬂe” character to the pattern.

Specifying the range of notes in which  the arpeggiator will operate (Key Btm,  Key Top) “Key Btm,” “Key Top”: The arpeggiator will oper- ate when you play keys within the speciﬁed range.  Keys outside of this range can be played in the  normal manner, and will not be affected by the  arpeggiator on/off. For example if you set “Pattern” to Preset-0: UP,  check “Latch,” set “Key Top” to B3, and “Key  Btm” to C-1, playing a note B3 or lower will trig- ger the arpeggiator. Since “Latch” is on, the arpeg- gio will continue even after you release the keys.  You can use the C4 and higher keys to play con-
ventionally along with the arpeggio sounded by  the B3 and lower keys. To change the arpeggio,  play keys in the range of B3 and below.
Specifying the range of velocities in  which the arpeggiator will operate (Vel  Btm, Vel Top) “Vel Btm,” “Vel Top”: The arpeggiator will oper- ate when you play notes with a velocity (playing  strength) that is within the speciﬁed range. Notes  played with a velocity outside this range will be  sounded normally, without regard to the arpeg- giator on/off.
Writing (saving) the arpeggiator set- tings Arpeggio parameters you edit in Program mode  are saved along with the data when you write the  program. For details on how to write, see “Saving  your edits” (☞p.45).
Linking the arpeggiator to a program You can specify whether the arpeggio settings writ- ten in a program will also be selected when you  switch to that program, or whether the existing  state of the arpeggiator will be maintained. With  the factory settings, the former setting is selected. If  you want to use the latter setting, check Program in  “Auto Arp” (GLOBAL 0: System, Basic page).
The arpeggiator in Combina- tion and Multi modes In Combination and Multi mode, the X50 provides  dual polyphonic arpeggiator functionality that  lets you use two arpeggio patterns simulta- neously. The settings in each of these modes are  made in the similar way.  As an example, the following explanation shows  how to make settings in Combination mode.
Using the arpeggiators as you play in  Combination mode 1. Press a [COMBI] button. (The button will light.)
You will enter Combination mode. (☞p.57  “Selecting combinations”) As you select various combinations, you will  notice that the [ARP ON/OFF] button will light  for some combinations. When you play a key  on the keyboard, the arpeggiator will start.

In Combination and Multi set, depending on  the arpeggiator A, B settings, the arpeggio  may not start when you press the [ARP ON/ OFF] button to turn it on. (☞p.96 “Select the  arpeggiator(s) that will run”)
2. As described in “Arpeggio controllers” (☞p.91)  and in “Editing arpeggio settings that appear in  the display” (below), operate the controllers or  edit the parameters to hear how the arpeggio  changes.
Note: The [ARP ON/OFF] button and the  REALTIME CONTROLS C-mode [1] (ARP-GATE),  [2] (ARP-VELOCITY), [3] (ARP-LENGTH), and [4]  (TEMPO) knobs are valid for both arpeggiators A  and B. Their state will be memorized when the  combination is written.
Editing arpeggio settings that  appear in the display You can make arpeggiator-related settings in the  COMBI 0: Play, Arp. Play A and B pages or in the  COMBI 7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls page. The 0: Play, Arp.  Play A and B pages contain selected parameters  (taken from the 7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Arp. A and B  pages) that are particularly effective for editing  during a performance. However, parameters other  than “Swing” can be controlled as described in  “Arpeggio controllers” (☞p.91). With the following exceptions, the display settings  in the 0: Play, Arp. Play A and B pages are essen- tially the same as for a program. 1. Access the COMBI 0: Play, Arp. Play A page,
and make settings for arpeggiator A.
2. Access the COMBI 0: Play, Arp. Play B page,
and make settings for arpeggiator B.

Select the arpeggiator(s) that will run Use the “Arpeggiator Run” check boxes to specify  the arpeggiator(s) that you want to run. The  arpeggiator(s) that are checked here will operate  when the [ARP ON/OFF] button is on. However, the arpeggiator will play a timbre only  if the table displayed beside the check boxes  assigns arpeggiator A or B to a Timbre 1–8. These  settings are made in COMBI 7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls,  Setup page “Assign” (☞p.97).
Arpeggiator-A, Arpeggiator-B For each arpeggiator A and B, you can make set- tings for “Pattern,” “Reso (Resolution),” “Octave,”  “Sort,” “Latch,” “Key Sync,” and “Keyboard.”  (☞p.92)
Checking the structure of a user arpeg- gio pattern Let’s see how arpeggiators of the combination is  constructed. 1. Select combination C053: Echo Jamm, and look
at the Arp. Play A page and Arp. Play B page.
• As you can see from the “Timbre Assign” table  in the upper right, arpeggiator A is assigned to  timbre 4 and 8, and arpeggiator B is assigned to  timbre 2. When you play the keyboard, the Dr- BigBeats 2 arpeggio pattern will play the pro- gram B084: Drum’n’Bass Kit of timbre 4. The  Gt-Stab Rhythm arpeggio pattern will play the  program B108: Funkin’ Guitar of timbre 2.
• If you uncheck “Arpeggiator Run A” or
• Independently specify whether A and B will
operate. ☞step 6
• Select an arpeggio pattern and set parameters
independently for A and B. ☞step 7
• Make Scan Zone page settings so that you can
use keyboard range or playing velocity to  switch between normal playing and arpeggi- ated playing, or to switch between arpeggiators  A and B. ☞step 8
• Make settings for timbres that will be silent  when the arpeggiator is Off, and will sound  only when the arpeggiator is On. ☞step 10
Arpeggiator on/off Each time you press the [ARP ON/OFF] button,  the arpeggiator will be switched on or off. When  on, the [ARP ON/OFF] button will light. The  selected arpeggio pattern will begin when you  play the keyboard. The on/off setting is saved  when the combination is written into memory. Note: If “Assign” is Off or “Arpeggiator Run” is  not checked, the arpeggiator will not operate even  if this key is on.
Arpeggiator settings 1. Select COMBI 0: Play, Prog page.
Select programs for the timbres that you wish  to use. For this example, select any desired  program for timbres 1–4.
2. Select COMBI 2: Ed–TimbreParam. MIDI page.
For the timbres that you will be using, set  “Status” to INT, and set “MIDI Channel” to  Gch or to the global MIDI channel (set in  GLOBAL 1: MIDI “MIDI Channel”). For this example, set timbres 1–4 to a “Status”  of INT, and timbres 5–8 to a “Status” of Off. Set  the “MIDI Channel” of timbres 1–4 to Gch.
3. Select COMBI 7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Setup page.
4. Set “(cid:2) (Temp)” to specify the tempo.
This is the same as for a program (☞p.92).  However, the tempo is shared by both  arpeggiators A and B.
5. Make “Assign” settings.
Assign arpeggiator A or B to the desired  timbres. Each timbre will be played by the  arpeggiator that has been assigned to it.
6. Make “Arpeggiator Run” settings.
Check the arpeggiator(s) that you want to  operate. The arpeggiator(s) checked here will  run when the [ARP ON/OFF] button is turned  on. With the settings shown in the display for steps  2 and 3, turning the [ARP ON/OFF] button on  will cause arpeggiator A to operate for timbres  1 and 2, and arpeggiator B to operate for timbre  3. When the [ARP ON/OFF] button is turned  off, timbres 1–4 will sound as a layer. If all timbres “Assign” are Off, or if neither  “Arpeggiator Run” A or B is checked, the  arpeggiator will not function.
7. In the Arp. A and Arp. B pages, set the
parameters for arpeggiators A and B. The parameters for A and B are the same as for  a program (☞p.92).
8. In the Scan Zone page, specify the range in
which arpeggiators A and B will operate. The parameters for A and B are the same as for  a program (☞p.94). You can use keyboard ranges or playing  velocity to operate the arpeggiator, or to switch  between arpeggiators A and B. By using the  COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Key page and COMBI  6: Ed–Vel Zone, Vel page to set keyboard ranges  and velocity ranges in conjunction with each  other, you can create even more variations. 9. If you wish to save the edited combination
settings in internal memory, turn off memory  protect in Global mode, and write the  combination.

10.The “Status,” “MIDI Channel” and “Assign”  settings shown in the display of steps 2 and 3  can be made so that certain timbres will sound  only when the arpeggiator is On, and will be  silent when the arpeggiator is not Off.
Setting examples Although this is a somewhat sophisticated editing  technique, we will describe the settings of one of  the preset combinations as an example.
Combination A021: Urban Nature RnB Select combination A021: Urban Nature RnB, and  play it. Before you play, make sure that the global MIDI  channel (GLOBAL 1: MIDI “MIDI Channel”) is set  to 01. • Arpeggiator A is assigned to T (timbre) 4 and 5.  When you play the keyboard, the arpeggio pat- tern Dr-Nature RnB will sound only the T4  program B004: Trance/GarageKit.
• The arpeggio pattern uses the Fixed Note set-
ting, which is appropriate when playing a drum  arpeggio. (“Fixed Note” is checked in, GLO- BAL 5: Arp.Pattern, Setup page.) With this set- ting, the arpeggio pattern will always play the  speciﬁed pitches regardless of the note numbers  received from the keyboard. (☞p.102)
• The A “Key Btm” and “Key Top” (COMBI 7:
Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Scan Zone page) are set so that  arpeggiator A will operate only for notes B3  and lower.
• Arpeggiator A is also assigned to T5, but this is  so that the T4 program B004: Trance/GarageKit  will sound only when the arpeggiator is on. Notice the timbre settings for T4 and T5

• If the arpeggiator is off, playing the keyboard  will sound the timbre(s) that are set to Gch or  to the global MIDI channel (in this case, 01).  Since the “MIDI Channel” of T4 is set to 02, it  will not sound. T5 is set to Gch, but since “Sta- tus” is Off it will not sound.
• Any MIDI channel that is assigned to a timbre  will trigger the arpeggiator. In this case, these  will be “MIDI Channel” 02 and Gch (global  MIDI channel). When the arpeggiator is on,  playing the keyboard will trigger arpeggiator A
98
which is assigned to T5 (Gch). T4 will be  sounded by arpeggiator A. Since the “Status”  of T5 is Off, it will not sound.
• Since the “Status” of T5 is Off, it will not
sound, regardless of whether the arpeggiator is  on or off. It is a dummy timbre that causes T4 to  sound only when the arpeggiator is on.
Combination B071: “In The Pocket” Select and play combination B071: “In The  Pocket.” Before you play, make sure that the global MIDI  channel (GLOBAL 1: MIDI “MIDI Channel”) is set  to 01. • Arpeggiator A is assigned to T7 and T8, and
arpeggiator B is assigned to T5. When you play  the keyboard, the T7 program C004: HipHop  Kit will be sounded by the arpeggio pattern  Dr-In The Pocket. The T5 program A066:  Chord Trigger will be sounded by the arpeggio  pattern Bs-Echo.
• The B “Key Btm” and “Key Top” (COMBI 7:
Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Scan Zone page) are set so that  arpeggiators B will operate only for the G3  note and above.
• Arpeggiator B is assigned to T8 as well, but this  setting is so that the T7 program C004: HipHop  Kit will sound only when the arpeggiator is on.  See the preceding section “Combination A021:  Urban Nature RnB” (☞p.98).
• If you moved from Multi mode to Global mode,
playing the keyboard will sound the program  and arpeggiator of the track that matches the  global MIDI channel (GLOBAL 1).
Memory structure for the arpeggio  patterns The X50 has 251 arpeggio pattern memory areas,  divided into preset arpeggio patterns and user  arpeggio patterns as follows. Preset arpeggio patterns: There are ﬁve patterns;  UP, DOWN, ALT1, ALT2, and RANDOM. The operation of these patterns is ﬁxed, and can- not be edited. User arpeggio patterns: There are 251 patterns -  U000–U250 - which can develop chords or phrases  in a wide variety of ways, based on the pitches  that you play on the keyboard or the timing at  which you play them. In GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern you can modify these  user arpeggio patterns, or create a new user arpeg- gio pattern from an initialized condition. Edited  user arpeggio patterns can be written to internal  memory areas U000–U250.
Changing the memory protect set- ting When you wish to edit a user arpeggio pattern,  ﬁrst turn off memory protect by unchecking the  Memory Protect “Arp. UsrPat” check box in the  GLOBAL 0: System, Preference page.
Saving and comparing data • The edits you perform in Global mode will be
preserved until you turn off the power is  turned off, but will be lost when the power is  turned off. Three types of data are handled in  Global mode: user drumkit settings (GLOBAL  4), arpeggiator settings (GLOBAL 5), and all  other global settings (GLOBAL 0–3). You into  its own memory area.
Creating a user arpeggio pattern
• Note that Compare can’t be used in Global  mode. If you want to edit a user drum kit or  user arpeggio pattern, you should ﬁrst use  “Copy Drum Kit” or “Copy Arpeggio Pattern”  to copy the drum kit or user arpeggio pattern  you want to edit into a vacant number, and  then edit the copy.
Caution when the arpeggiator is  used by multiple programs or combi- nations When you edit a user arpeggio pattern, the  changes will have an effect on any Program, Com- bination, or Multi set that uses this same pattern.
Initializing an arpeggio pattern With the factory settings, all of the X50’s user  arpeggio patterns U000–U250 contain preloaded  data. If you want to create a new arpeggio pattern,  choose an appropriate arpeggio pattern and ini- tialize it. Note: Even if you’ve initialized a pattern, you can  reload the factory preset data at any time using the  Global mode. (☞p.111) 1. Press the [GLOBAL] button to enter Global
mode, and access the GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern,  Setup page.
2. Select the arpeggio pattern that you want to
initialize.
3. Access the GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern, Edit page. 4. Press the [UTILITY] button. From the menu
that appears, choose “Initialize Steps” to open  the dialog box.
5. If you set “Type” to Empty, the pattern will be  initialized to an empty state without any tones.  If you select Full, all tones will be occupied. In  this example, choose Empty and press the  [MENU/OK] button. The pattern will be  initialized.

the arpeggio pattern you wish to edit is  selected, or a program that you wish to use as a  basis for editing the arpeggio pattern.
2. Press the [ARP ON/OFF] button to turn the
arpeggiator on (the button will light). Even if you moved to Global mode from a  program in which the arpeggiator was turned  off, you can use the [ARP ON/OFF] button to  turn it on.
3. Access the GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern, Setup page.
4. In “Pattern,” select the arpeggio pattern that
you wish to edit. For this example, select an empty user arpeggio  pattern. If a blank pattern is selected, playing the  keyboard will not start an arpeggio. Note: Although preset arpeggio patterns Preset- 0–Preset-4 can be selected, they cannot be  edited.
5. In “Lgth (Length),” specify the length of the
pattern. After the pattern has played for the length  speciﬁed, it will return to the beginning. This  setting can also be changed during or after  editing. For this example, set it to 8.
6. Make settings for the “(cid:2) (Tempo),” “Reso
(Resolution),” “Oct (Octave),” “Sort,” “Latch,”  “K.Sync (Key Sync.),” and “Kbd (Keyboard)”  parameters. Note: These are program parameters, but can be  set from here as well. If after moving here from Program mode, you  modify these parameters and wish to keep  your changes, return to Program mode and  write the program. These parameters are not  saved by “Write Arpeggio Pattern.” For this example, make the settings shown in  the illustration 3.
7. The “Type (Arpeggio Type),” “Octave Motion,”  and “Fixed Note” parameters specify how the  arpeggio will be developed.
100
These settings can be changed during or after  editing.
8. Access the Edit page.
A pattern consists of Steps and Tones.
• Step: A user arpeggio pattern can have a maxi-
mum of 48 steps. The arpeggiator will play  from the ﬁrst step, in steps equal to the timing  value speciﬁed by “Reso (Resolution).” The  vertical lines of the grid shown in the center of  the display indicate the steps. Use “Step (Step No.)” to select the step. For  each step, specify “Ptch (Pitch Offset),” “Gt  (Gate),” “Vel (Velocity)” and “Flam.” To change the step, use the ClickPoint to select  “Step” (Step No.), and then use the [VALUE]  dial or [INC][DEC] button to select the desired  step. In this page you can use the ClickPoint  [√][®] to move between steps.
• Tone: At each step, a chord consisting of up to
4 3 2 1 0
05
01 Lgth(Length)
Step No.
Creating an example pattern
1. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 01, and press the [0]
button.
2. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 02, and press the [1]
button.
3. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 03, and press the [2]
button.
4. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 04, and press the [1]
button.
5. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 05, and press the [3]
button.
6. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 06, and press the [1]
button.
7. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 07, and press the [2]
button.
8. Set “Step (Step No.)” to 08, and press the [1]
button.
9. When you play the keyboard as shown in the  illustration, the arpeggiator will begin playing. Tone 0 corresponds to the pitch of the lowest  key of chord you play on the keyboard. (If  “Sort” is unchecked, it will correspond to the  pitch of the ﬁrst note you play.)
10.For steps 01–08, make settings for “Ptch (Pitch
Offset),” “Gt (Gate),” “Vel (Velocity),” and  “Flam.”
Creating a user arpeggio pattern
“Ptch (Pitch Offset)”: This offsets the pitch of  the arpeggio note in semitones up or down.  You can input the same tone for each step, and  change the “Ptch (Pitch Offset)” value for each  to create a melody using a single tone.  (☞“Melody pattern”) “Gt (Gate)”: Specify the length of the arpeggio  note for each step. With a setting of LGT, the  note will continue sounding either until the  next note of the same tone or until the end of  the pattern. With a setting of Off, the note will  not sound. “Vel (Velocity)”: Specify the strength of the note.  With a setting of Key, the note will sound at the  strength with which it was actually played. Note: The “Gt (Gate)” and “Vel (Velocity)”  settings you make here will be valid if the “Gt  (Gate)” and “Vel (Velocity)” parameters (PROG  7: Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Setup page) of the program  selected in Program mode are set to Step. If  these parameters have a setting other than  Step, the “Gt (Gate)” and “Vel (Velocity)” that  were speciﬁed for each individual step will be  ignored, and all notes of the arpeggio will  sound according to the settings in PROG 7: Ed– Arp/Ctrls. Be sure to verify the settings of the  program. Note: Before you set “Gt (Gate),” move the  REALTIME CONTROLS C-mode [ARP-GATE]  knob to the center position (12 o’clock). Note: Before you set “Vel (Velocity),” move the  REALTIME CONTROLS C-mode [ARP- VELOCITY] knob to the center position (12  o’clock).
11.To change the user arpeggio pattern name, use
the Utility “Rename Arpeggio Pattern”  (☞p.112).
12.If you wish to save the edited user arpeggio
pattern to internal memory, be sure to Write the  user arpeggio pattern (☞p.104). If you turn off the power without writing, the  edited contents will be lost.
13.If you wish to save the state of the program at
the same time, return to Program mode and  write the program (☞p.45).

6. Input the closed hi-hat (Tone02).
Set “Step (Step No.)” to 01, 02, 03, 05, 06, and  07, and press the [2] button for each.
7. Input the open hi-hat (Tone03).
Set “Step (Step No.)” to 04, and press the [3]  button. Then set “Step (Step No.)” to 08, and  press the [3] button.
If “Mode (Fixed Note Mode)” is set to Trigger  All Tones, playing a single note on the  keyboard will cause the rhythm pattern to play. If “Mode (Fixed Note Mode)” is set to Trigger  As Played, playing a single note on the  keyboard will cause only the kick (Tone00) to  play. Playing two notes on the keyboard will  cause only the kick (Tone00) and snare  (Tone01) to play. In this way, the number of  keys that you play will be played by the same  number of tones.
8. Set the parameters for each step.
Use “Vel (Velocity)” etc. to add accents to the  rhythm pattern. Note: The “Gt (Gate)” and “Vel (Velocity)”  settings you make here will be valid if the  “Gate” and “Velocity” parameters (PROG 7:  Ed–Arp/Ctrls, Setup page) of the program  selected in Program mode are set to Step. If these parameters have a setting other than  Step, the “Gt (Gate)” and “Vel (Velocity)” that  were speciﬁed for each individual step will be  ignored, and all notes of the arpeggio will  sound according to the speciﬁed gate and  velocity. Note: Before you set “Gate,” move the  REALTIME CONTROLS C-mode [1] (ARP- GATE) knob to the center position (12 o’clock). Note: Before you set “Velocity,” move the  REALTIME CONTROLS C-mode [2] (ARP- VELOCITY) knob to the center position (12  o’clock).

Saving a user arpeggio When you’re ﬁnished editing, you should save the  user arpeggio. The “Tempo,” “Pattern,” “Octave,” “Resolution,”  “Sort,” “Latch,” “Key Sync.,” and “Keyboard” set- tings of a user arpeggio pattern are parameters  that are saved together with the program, combi- nation, or multi set. These parameters are not  saved by the Write operation described here. If  you want to save these parameters, return to the  previous mode and write the data. Note: You’ll need to turn off the memory protect  setting for user arpeggio patterns. In the GLOBAL  0: System, Preference page, uncheck the Memory  Protect “Arp. UsrPat” box. (☞p.88) 1. Press the [UTILITY] button to access the utility
menu, and choose “Write Arpeggio Patterns.”
2. To write (save) your settings, press the
[MENU/OK] button. A dialog box will ask you to conﬁrm that you  want to write the arpeggio patterns.
3. Press the [MENU/OK] button to write your
settings, or press the [EXIT/CANCEL] button if  you decide not to write. The arpeggio patterns will be written (saved).
Arpeggiator settings
Dual polyphonic arpeggiator editing  in Combi and Multi modes Here we will use a combination as an example in  our explanation. The same procedure applies when editing an  arpeggio pattern in Multi mode. If you have entered this mode from the Combina- tion mode, the arpeggio pattern selected by the  combination will be affected by your editing. 1. In Combination mode, select a combination
that uses the arpeggio pattern you wish to edit. For this example, select a combination to which  arpeggiators A and B is assigned.
2. Press the [ARP ON/OFF] button to turn on the
arpeggiator (the button will light). Even if the arpeggiator had been turned off  when you moved here, you can use the [ARP  ON/OFF] button to turn it on. However, if  “Arpeggiator Run” A or B are not checked, and  if no timbres have been assigned in “Assign,”  then the arpeggiator will not operate.
3. Access the GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern, Setup page.
4. If you moved here from Combination mode,
use the “Arp (Arpeggio Select)” A and B to  select the arpeggiator that you wish to edit. If this is A, your editing will apply to the  parameters and user arpeggio pattern of  arpeggiator A. If this is B, your editing will apply to the  parameters and user arpeggio pattern of  arpeggiator B.
5. Switch between arpeggiators A and B, and edit
their respective user arpeggio patterns. If you wish to stop one of the arpeggiators,  return to Combination mode, and in COMBI 0:  Play, select the Arp. A or the Arp. B page and  uncheck the “Arpeggiator Run” check box.
6. To modify the name of a user arpeggio pattern,
use the Utility “Rename Arpeggio Pattern”  (☞p.112).
7. If you wish to save the edited user arpeggio
nize to the “(cid:2) (Tempo)” based on the timing of the
already-running arpeggiator. Note: If “Key Sync.” is checked, A and B will each  operate on their own timing.

Samples, with velocity switching
• Each note has separate settings for the most  important sound parameters, including vol- ume, ﬁlter cutoff and resonance, envelope  attack and decay, pitch.
• You can specify the insert effect routing and
master effect send level for each note. For  example, you can use this to send just the snare  to a compressor.
You can use Drum Kits only in Programs whose  “Oscillator Mode” is set to “Drums.”
Drum Kit memory structure The X50 has 49 Drum Kits, divided into Internal,  User, and GM (General MIDI) groups as shown  below.  You can edit or write into any of the locations  except for the GM bank, which cannot be erased. If you want to start with a GM bank drum kit and  edit it, use the “Copy Drum Kit” utility to select a  drum kit and copy it to the USER bank. Drum Kit banks

Drum Kit Programs and Oscillator  Mode The PROG 1: Ed–Basic, Prog Basic page “Oscilla- tor Mode” setting speciﬁes whether the oscillator  will be a drum kit or a conventional multisample  (such as piano or strings). You can verify this setting in the PROG 2: Ed– Pitch, OSC1 page. If “Oscillator Mode” is set to  Single, you’ll be able to specify two multisamples  and a velocity switch. If this is set to Double,  you’ll be able to make an additional set of settings  in the OSC2 page.
If “Oscillator Mode” is set to “Drums,” you’ll be  able to make settings for one drum kit. A drum kit  does have velocity switch settings, but these set- tings are made for the drum kit in Global mode,  and cannot be edited or saved in Program mode.
Before you start editing…
First, select a Drum Program In Global Mode, you’ll play the kit that you’re  editing as if you were playing it from within the  Program, Combination, or Multi set which was  selected before you entered Global mode. So, before you enter the GLOBAL 4: DKit pages,  it’s best to select a Program which is already set up  for drums in Program mode, with the appropriate  EG settings, effects, and so on. Choose a drum  Program such as “A020: Standard Kit 3.” If you moved from Multi mode to Global mode,  playing the keyboard will sound the program and  arpeggiator of the track that matches the global  MIDI channel (GLOBAL 1).
Match the note mapping and key  position for the drum kit In order for the note mappings to match the key- board, the Oscillator’s Octave setting needs to be  +0 [8']. All Drum Kit Programs should have this  setting already. If you’re unsure, you can check  this yourself:  1. Access the Program mode PROG 1: Ed–Basic,
OSC1 page.
2. Check that the “Octave” parameter (near the
top of the page) is set to +0 [8']. With a setting other than +0 [8'], the  relationship between the keys and the Drum  Kit sound map will be incorrect.
Check the memory protect setting When you wish to edit a user drum kit, ﬁrst turn  off memory protect by unchecking the Memory  Protect “Drum Kit” check box in the GLOBAL 0:  System Preference page.

when the power is turned off, so you need to  write (save) your edits if you want to keep  these changes. Three types of data are handled  in Global mode: user drumkit settings (GLO- BAL 4), arpeggiator settings (GLOBAL 5), and  all other global settings (GLOBAL 0–3). You can  save each type of data into its own memory  area.
• Note that Compare can’t be used in Global  mode. If you want to edit a user drum kit or  user arpeggio pattern, you should ﬁrst use  “Copy Drum Kit” or “Copy Arpeggio Pattern”  to copy the drum kit or user arpeggio pattern  you want to edit into a vacant number, and  then edit the copy.
Caution when a drum kit is used by  more than one program When you edit a drum kit, your changes will affect  all programs that use that same drum kit. If you  want to edit one of the preloaded drum kits, it is  best to copy the drum kit into a vacant area of the  USER bank, and then edit the copy of the drum  kit.

Editing Drum Kits
Basic Editing 1. Select the Program that you wish to use while
editing the Drum Kit. For more details, see “First, select a Drum  Program” (☞p.107).
2. Press the [GLOBAL] button to enter Global
mode.
3. Access the GLOBAL 4: DKit, High Sample
page.
4. Use the “Drum Kit” parameter, at the top of the  screen, to select the Drum Kit that you wish to  edit.
5. Use the “Key” parameter to select the note that
you wish to edit. Use the front panel [VALUE] dial etc. to edit the  setting. As a shortcut, you can also hold down the  [ENTER] button and play a note on the  keyboard. This “Key” selection applies to all three Drum  Kit editing tabs.
6. Use the “Assign” check box to specify whether
the key will have its own settings, or use the  same settings as the next higher note. If “Assign” is checked, the key will have its  own settings. This is the default. If “Assign” is not checked, the key won’t have  its own settings. Instead, it will use the same  settings as the next higher note–except that the  drum samples will be played at a lower pitch.  The pitch that sounds will depend on the  PROG 2: Ed–Pitch, OSC1 page “Pitch Slope”  setting. Use this setting when you want only to change  the pitch, such as with tom or cymbal sounds.
Editing Drum Kits
Press the [CATEGORY] button to view a list of  the drum samples organized by category. For  details on how to make a selection, see  “Selecting programs by category” (☞p.38).
3. Select a drum sample name in the list so that it
is highlighted.
4. Press the [MENU/OK] button to conﬁrm the
selection.
5. Press the [PAGE+] button to access the
GLOBAL 4: DKit- Low Sample page.
6. Specify the Low Drumsample as you did in
steps 2–4. Now you have assigned drum samples to the  High Drumsample and Low Drumsample.  Next, we’ll assign the velocity range for these  drum samples.
7. Set the “Velocity SW L→H”.
The Low drum sample will sound when you  play a key less strongly than the speciﬁed  velocity value, and the High drum sample will  sound when you play more strongly. For example if you set “Velocity SW L→H” to  100, the drum sample assigned to “Low” will  sound when you play the keyboard softly, and  the multisample assigned to “High” will sound  when you play strongly. Note: If you don’t want to use this function, set  “Velocity SW L→H” to 001. Only the High  drum sample will sound. Note: This is the same type of function as  velocity multisample switching in a program.  (☞p.48)
Fine-tuning the sound of each sam- ple 1. If you like, adjust the Levels for the two Drum
Samples. Set the High and Low “Level” settings to adjust  the volume balance.
2. Set the tuning and EG parameters as desired.
For each Drum Sample, you can control offsets  to the Program’s settings for transposition,  tuning, and EG attack and decay times.
3. You can adjust the sound or specify reverse
playback for each drum sample. For each drum sample, set the “FC (Filter  Cutoff)” and “Reso (Resonance)” parameters,  and specify “S.Ofs” and “Rev (Reverse).” (☞PG  p.87)
Kit. You can also copy settings from one “Key” to  another, using the “Copy Key Setup” utility  command.
Using Exclusive Groups 1. Access the GLOBAL 4: DKit, Voice/Mixer
page.
2. Use the Excl Group (Exclusive Groups) to make  one drum sound cut off another drum sound -  such as closed and open hi-hats. For example, let’s say that you’ve assigned an  open hi-hat and a closed hi-hat to the same  exclusive group:
• Play the open hi-hat sound. • While it’s still ringing, play the closed hi-hat. • The open hi-hat sound will be cut off–simulat-
ing the action of a physical hi-hat.
Using Hold The Program Hold parameter can be especially  useful for drum programs, since it lets the samples  ring out naturally regardless of how long you hold  down the note. The way that this works depends  on settings in both the Program and the Drum Kit,  as described below. To enable Hold: 1. Access the PROG 1: Ed–Basic, Prog Basic page. 2. Voice Assign, make sure that the “Hold” check
box is checked. Once you’ve turned on “Hold” for the  Program, the function is controlled on a note- by-note basis according to settings within the  Drum Kit.
3. Access the GLOBAL 4: DKit, Voice/Mixer
page.
4. For each key, set the Enable Note Off Receive
parameter as desired. If this check box is unchecked, the key will be  held. If it is checked, the key will not be held. If you turn off “Hold” in the Program, no keys  will be held - regardless of their “Enable Note  Off Receive” setting.

2. Press the [MENU/OK] button to write the
drum kit data. A dialog box will ask you for conﬁrmation.
3. Press the [MENU/OK] button to save, or press  the [EXIT/CANCEL] button if you decide not  to save. The drum kit data will be written (saved).
Using Drum Kits
Controlling effects for each key A drum kit lets you set the insert effect and master  effect send for each key. 1. Access the PROG 8: Ed–InsertFX, BUS page. 2. Make sure that the “Use DKit Setting” check
box is checked. When “Use DKit Setting” is checked, the  Program will use the “BUS Select” and Effects  Send settings for each key of the Drum Kit. When “Use DKit Setting” is unchecked, the  Program will ignore the Drum Kit’s “BUS  Select” and Effects Send settings.
3. Access the GLOBAL 4: DKit, Voice/Mixer
page.
4. Use the “BUS Select” parameter to send drum  sounds through their own Insert effect, or to the  individual outputs. If you like, you can send each note to its own  Insert effect, or to the individual audio outputs,  in addition to the main L/R outputs. For example, you might send all snare sounds  to IFX, and the remaining sounds to L/R.
5. Use “Send1(MFX1)” and “Send2(MFX2)” to set
the send levels to the master effects.
Setting the pan for each key To use separate pan settings for each key: 1. Access the PROG 5: Ed–Amp1/2, Level/Pan
page.
2. Under Pan, make sure that the “Use DKit
Setting” check box is checked. When “Use DKit Setting” is checked, the  Program will use the pan settings for each key  of the Drum Kit.
3. Access the GLOBAL 4: DKit, Voice/Mixer
page.
4. Use the “Pan” parameter to specify the key’s
stereo output position.
This operation will rewrite any data that had  been previously written to the internal  memory. If you don’t want to lose this data,  you should save it using the included “X50  Editor/Plug-In Editor”; or save the data using  a commercially available data ﬁler.
1. Press the [GLOBAL] button to enter Global
mode. (The button will light.)
2. Press the [EXIT] button.
You will be in the GLOBAL 0: System page.
3. Press the [UTILITY] button to access the Utility
menu.
4. Use the ClickPoint [†] to select “Load Preload
Data,” and press the center. A dialog box will appear.
5. Choose “Kind,” and use the [VALUE] dial or  the [INC][DEC] buttons to select the data that  you want to load. Choose All if you want to restore all settings to  the factory-set state. If you execute this with the  “All” setting, all programs, combinations, multi  sets, drum kits, arpeggio patterns, and global  settings will be loaded.
6. Press the [MENU/OK] button.
A dialog box will ask you to conﬁrm the  operation.
7. Press the [MENU/OK] button once again.
All preloaded data will be loaded.
If the “Memory Protected” dialog box  appears, un-check the memory protect  setting, and perform the load operation once  again (☞p.88).
Loading individual banks or data  items The X50 allows you to load individual banks, pro- grams, or combinations. Multi set, drum kits  andarpeggio patterns can also be loaded individu- ally or as a group. This is convenient when you want to restore just  one item from the factory preload data, or when  you want to rearrange combinations in a speciﬁc  order for live performance.
When rearranging programs, you need to be  aware that if you write them to another bank  or number, any combination that had used the  program formerly occupying the writing  destination will sound differently.
For example if you want to load combination  B015 into C127, proceed as follows.
1. Access the dialog box as described in steps 1–4,
above.
2. Choose “Kind,” and use the [VALUE] dial or
the [INC][DEC] buttons etc. to select  Combination.
3. Use the ClickPoint [†] to move down, and use
the [VALUE] dial or [INC][DEC] buttons to  select Single.
4. In the same way, select combination B015 as the
copy-source.
5. In the same way, select combination C127 as the
load-destination (“To”).
6. Press the [MENU/OK] button.
A dialog box will ask you to conﬁrm the  operation.
7. Press the [MENU/OK] button once again.
The data will be loaded, and the preloaded  combination B015 will be copied into C127.

MIDI data dump You can save data by transmitting it as MIDI  exclusive data to a connected MIDI data ﬁler, com- puter, or to a second X50 unit. (☞PG p.83) The following data can be transmitted via MIDI  data dump to an external data ﬁler or similar  device. • Programs, combinations, multi sets, global set-
tings, user drum kits, user arpeggio patterns
Using the “X50 Editor/Plug-In Editor”  control plug-in software to save data You can use the “X50 Editor/Plug-In Editor” con- trol plug-in to save X50 data. For more details, see  “Editor/Plug-In Editor Manual” (PDF).

About the Edit Buffer
About the memory in Program, Com- bination, and Multi modes When you select a program, combination, or multi  set in PROG 0: Play, COMBI 0: Play, and MULTI 0:  Play, the data of the selected program, combina- tion, or multi set is called into the X50’s edit buffer. When you edit the parameters in pages such as 0:  Play, your editing will modify the data in the edit  buffer. If you wish to save this modiﬁed data into internal  memory, you must perform the Write operation. When you perform the Write operation, the data  in the edit buffer is written to the speciﬁed pro- gram number, combination number or Multi set  number of the speciﬁed bank. If you select another program, combination or  Multi set number without writing, the data of the  newly selected program, combination or multi set  number will be called into the edit buffer, and  your changes will be lost. When you press the [COMPARE] button in these  modes, the data in memory (i.e., the written con- tent) is temporarily called into the edit buffer. This  lets you compare the settings being edited with  the settings prior to editing.
Editing applies to the data in the edit  buffer. Programs or combinations will play  according to the data in the edit buffer.
When you write, the program  or combination settings will  be saved in internal memory.

Power supply
Power does not turn on
Is the AC adapter connected to an outlet?  ☞p.23 Is the Power switch turned on?
→ Turn on the rear panel Power switch. ☞p.23
Display
The power is turned on, but nothing is  shown in the display. The X50 functions normally when you  play the keyboard or perform other oper- ations.
Due to changes in the surrounding tempera- ture, the display may on rare occasions be difﬁ- cult or impossible to read. If this occurs,  perform the following procedure.
1. While holding down the [EXIT/CANCEL]
button, press the [UTILITY] button. The  [GLOBAL] button will blink, and the Global  mode Update Global Setting dialog box will  appear.
If you are unable to read the display, or if the  Update Global Setting dialog box does not  appear, check whether the [GLOBAL] button  is blinking. If the [GLOBAL] button is lit or  dark, the X50 may be writing data that was  received from an external connected MIDI  device, or may be responding to a request for  output. If so, make sure that the X50 is not  writing data from an external connected MIDI  device or transmitting data in response to a  request, or that any such operation has been  completed. Then turn the power of the X50 off  and on again, and repeat this procedure from  step 1.
2. Use the [VALUE] dial to adjust the LCD
contrast.
3. Press the [MENU/OK] button.
The LCD contrast setting will be memorized.
Note: Other global settings will also be memorized  at this time.
Troubleshooting
The power is turned on, but the display  does not display normally, or an error  message is displayed. There is no sound  when you play the keyboard, and the X50  does not function normally.
This type of problem may occur if a data writ- ing operation to internal memory was not com- pleted correctly, for example if the power of the  X50 was turned off while a program or other  data was being written. If this occurs, use the  following procedure to initialize the X50’s  internal memory.
1. Turn off the power. 2. Hold down the [ENTER] button and the [0]
button, and turn on the power. The X50 will be initialized, and the factory  preload data will be written into internal  memory. While the data is being written, the  display will indicate “Now writing into  internal memory.”
Audio output
No sound
Are connections made correctly to your amp,  mixer, or headphones? Is your amp or mixer turned on? Is Local Control turned on? In GLOBAL 1: MIDI, check the “Local Control  On” check box. ☞PG p.82 Is the [VOLUME] slider raised? ☞p.12 If there is no sound from the INDIVIDUAL  OUTPUT 1, 2 jacks, make sure that “BUS  Select” or “BUS Select” following the insert  effect is set to 1, 2, 1/2. ☞p.81 If speciﬁc tracks in Multi mode do not  sound, Make sure that the “PLAY/MUTE” is  set to PLAY. ☞p.70 Make sure that the “Status” is INT or BTH.  ☞p.71 Are the “Key Zone” and “Velocity Zone” set so  that sound will be produced when you play?  ☞p.65
Notes do not stop
In PROG 1: Ed–Basic, select the Prog Basic  page, make sure that the “Hold” check box is  unchecked. ☞PG p.6

Noise or oscillation is heard
When using the BPM/MIDI Sync. function to  control the delay time of an effect, noise may  occur in the delay sound. This noise is due to  discontinuities in the delay sound, and is not a  malfunction. Some effects, such as 015: St.AnalogRecd, gen- erate noise intentionally. It is also possible to  create oscillation using a ﬁlter with resonance.  These are not malfunctions.
Programs and Combinations
Settings for oscillator 2 are not displayed
Make sure that the PROG 1: Ed–Basic, Prog  Basic page “Mode (Oscillator Mode)” parame- ter is set to Double.
A combination does not play correctly  after you load data
Are the bank/numbers of the programs used  by the combination the same as when the com- bination was created?
→ If you have switched program banks, you can  use the Change all bank references menu com- mand to change the program bank for each tim- bre of a combination. ☞PG p.77
Effects
Effects are not applied
Are the Effect Global SW IFX Off, MFX1 Off,  or MFX2 Off (GLOBAL 0: System, Basic page)  settings checked? ☞p.87 If you are in Combination, and Multi mode,  and master effects are not applied when you  raise the S1(Send1(MFX1)) or S2(Send2(MFX2))  of the timbre/track, does Rtn1(Return 1) or  Rtn2(Return 2) from the master effect need to  be raised? ☞p.83 Alternatively, has Send 1 or Send 2 for each  oscillator of the program used by the timbre/ track been lowered? ☞p.84 The actual send level is determined by  multiplying the send setting of each oscillator  in the program with the send setting of the  timbre/track.
Arpeggiator
Arpeggiator does not start
Is the [ARP ON/OFF] button turned on (lit)? If the arpeggiator does not start for a combina- tion or Multi set, make sure that “Arpeggiator  Run” is checked, and that an arpeggiator is  selected for “Assign.” ☞p.96 Is the GLOBAL 1: MIDI “MIDI Clock” parame- ter set to Internal? ☞PG p.81
Multi set
Drum Kits
When you loaded data, a Multi set does  not sound correctly
Are the bank/number of the programs used by  the song the same as when the Multi set was  created?
A combination copied using “Copy From  Combi” sounds different than it did in  Combination mode
Did you make the correct settings in the Copy  From Combination dialog box? ☞p.72
→ In the Copy From Combination dialog box,
check the “Auto adjust Arpeggio setting” box  before you execute the copy.
The drum sample’s pitch does not change
You have left the “Assign” check box  unchecked, and want to play the drum sample  at the adjacent right a semitone lower, but the  pitch does not change.
→ If you have selected a drum program in Pro-
gram mode, and then want to edit the drum kit  in Global mode, go to the PROG 2: Ed–Pitch,  OSC1 page and set “Pitch Slope” to +1.0 before  you enter Global mode.
Audition
No sound when the [AUDITION] button is  turned on
This instrument does not respond to  incoming MIDI data
Are all MIDI cables connected correctly?  ☞p.31, 34 Is the MIDI data being received on the channel  on which it is being transmitted? ☞PG p.81
This instrument does not respond cor- rectly to incoming MIDI data
Are the GLOBAL 1: MIDI page MIDI Filter set- tings “Enable Program Change,” “Bank,”  “Combi,” “Ctrl Change,” “AfterT,” and “Exelu- sire” each checked? ☞PG p.82 If you wish to receive MIDI exclusive mes- sages, is the GLOBAL 1: MIDI page MIDI Filter  “Exclusive” box checked? ☞p.32 Does this instrument support the types of mes- sages that are being sent to it?
When using USB, sound processing is  slow, or the tempo is unstable
Is the MIDI driver installed for the USB port  you’ve connected?
→ The driver must be installed for each USB port  you use. If you connect the X50 to a USB port  other than the port you used when installing  the KORG USB-MIDI Driver for Windows XP,  you’ll need to reinstall the KORG USB-MIDI  Driver. Have you made the correct “echo back” setting  on your computer and the correct Local Control  setting on the X50?
Included CD-ROM
Can’t install the driver included CD-ROM
Is the USB cable connected correctly? Is the CD-ROM inserted in your CD drive? → Make sure that the CD-ROM is inserted cor-
rectly. Could the lens of your CD drive be dirty?
→ Use a commercially-available lens cleaner to
clean the lens.
Troubleshooting
Are you attempting to install from a network  CD drive?
→ This software cannot be installed from a net-
work-connected CD drive. Are you able to use USB?
→ If you are using Windows XP, go to [Control  Panel] → [System], and select the [Hardware]  tab. In [Device Manager], check the settings for  Universal Serial Bus Controller and USB Root  Hub. Has the X50 been detected as an unknown  device?
→ If you are using Windows XP, go to [Control  Panel] → [System], select the [Hardware] tab,  and check [Device Manager]. If the X50 has not  been detected correctly, it will be displayed in  “Other devices” or “Unknown devices.” Recon- nect the USB cable; if the X50 is again displayed  as an “Unknown device,” the computer has  failed to detect it correctly. Delete the “Unknown  device” entry, and reinstall the driver. ☞p.28
Your software does not respond to the  X50
Is the USB cable connected correctly? Did you install the driver? Has your computer detected the connected  X50?
→ If you are using Windows XP, go to Control  Panel → “Sounds and Audio Devices Proper- ties” and click the Hardware tab.
→ If you are using Mac OS X, go to Macintosh HD
→ Application folder → Utility folder →  “Audio MIDI Settings,” select the “MIDI  Devices” tab, and check that the X50 has been  detected.
→ Some computers may not recognize the X50
because of their hardware conﬁguration. Check the X50’s assignments and USB-MIDI  port settings. The connected device or software may not sup- port the messages you are transmitting. See the  owner’s manual of the connected device or  software to verify that it responds to the mes- sages you are transmitting.
Software does not operate correctly Does your computer meet the operating  requirements of the software? Even if your computer meets the requirements,  there may be cases in which the software does  not operate correctly because of the computer  you are using.
