Play the keyboard, and you will hear the sound of bank A combination number 000. A combination consists of up to eight programs that are split, zoned, layered or velocity- switched across the keyboard. A combination can also use up to two Arpeggiators simulta- neously (a program can use only one Arpeggiator), letting you produce far more complex  sounds than a single program. Although you could simply continue selecting and playing different combinations, let’s start by  selecting and listening to the “basic” sounds of the X50 – programs. If you don’t hear any sound when you play the keyboard: Check the connections once  Note:  again. Also make sure that the X50’s VOLUME and the volume of your powered speakers or  stereo amp are turned up appropriately.

15,45.402,692.259,11.01,Introduction
15,45.402,514.5943106,142.3756894,384 different combinations let you  freely combine programs The X50 provides 384 user combinations. The fac- tory settings contain a wide variety of Preloaded  combinations. A combination allows you to use layers, splits, or  velocity switching etc. to combine up to eight pro- grams together with the effects and the two arpeg- giators, in order to create complex sounds that  could not be produced by a program. You can also  create combis that include external tone genera- tors.
15,45.402,408.142476,88.575524,Effects that can creatively manipu- late the sound or generate subtle  ambience The X50’s effects can be used in many ways, rang- ing from manipulating the sound dramatically to  creating spacious reverberation. (☞p.9 “High- quality sound featuring the HI synthesis system”)
15,45.402,308.090368,82.176632,4 channel audio outputs In addition to the (MAIN OUTPUT) L/MONO  and R main stereo audio outputs, X50 provides  two individual audio outputs, for a total of four  channels of audio output. The sound from each  oscillator, drum, timbre/track, or insert effect can  be routed freely to any output.
15,45.402,137.0392566,153.1757434,Multi mode plays multiple tracks of  data from an external sequencer In Multi mode, the X50 can operate as a 16-track  MIDI multi-timbral sound module, receiving mul- tiple tracks of performance data from an external  sequencer or similar device. Since you can use the  effects and the two arpeggiators as well, the X50  will also function as a more advanced sound mod- ule. You can create, save and recall numerous Multi  sets in the X50 and it also supports GM (General  MIDI System Level 1), making it easy to use as a  sound module for a desktop music system.

37,45.402,98.59553,481.73847,Local Control On settings Turn on the Echo Back function of the external  MIDI/USB sequencer or computer (so that data  received at MIDI IN will be re-transmitted from  MIDI OUT/USB), and turn off the X50’s Local  Control setting (so that X50’s keyboard and tone  generator will be internally disconnected). When you play the keyboard of the X50, the musical  data will be transmitted to the external MIDI  sequencer or computer, and then echoed back to  play the X50 tone generator. In other words, by turn- ing Local Control OFF, you can prevent notes from  being sounded in duplicate, as would otherwise  occur if a note were sounded by the X50’s own key- board and again by the data that was echoed-back. If the arpeggiator function is on, playing the X50’s  keyboard will not cause the arpeggiator to oper- ate, and only the musical data produced by play- ing the keyboard will be transmitted. The  arpeggiator will operate only in response to the  notes that are echoed-back and received at MIDI  IN. In this way, turning off Local Control prevents  the arpeggiator from operating in duplicate. Use this setting when you wish to record on the  external MIDI sequencer or computer only the  notes that trigger the arpeggiator, and to use the  echoed-back notes to operate the arpeggiator while  monitoring your recording or during playback. Note: If you want the note data produced by the  arpeggiator to be recorded on the external  sequencer/computer, set Local Control on, and  turn off the Echo Back setting of the external  sequencer/computer. The default setting for Local Control is On. To turn  off Local Control, the “Local Control On” (GLO- BAL 1: MIDI page) check box to uncheck it (☞PG  p.82). When using the X50 by itself, leave Local Control  turned on. (If this is off when X50 is used by itself,  playing the keyboard will not produce sound.) Note: The X50’s Local Control setting can be turned  Off by the Local Control Off message sent from the  editor when you start up X50 Plug-In Editor.

45,263.669,386.1593392,268.6847608,Using Controllers The X50 provides realtime controllers such as a  [MOD] wheel, pitch bend wheel, and [SW1] [SW2]  switches that let you make your performances  more expressive. These controls let you modify the tone, pitch, vol- ume, effects, etc. in realtime while you play. For example, a piano sound can be played realisti- cally using only the keyboard, but your perfor- mance will be more expressive if you connect a  damper pedal. If you’re playing guitar or wind  instrument sounds, you can use the [PITCH]  wheel to control the pitch or use the [MOD] wheel  to apply vibrato.  Note: In the pages that follow, our explanation will  center on the dedicated functionality of each  controller. However, you can also use these  controllers as sources for “alternate modulation”  or “effect dynamic modulation,” giving you a  much wider range of possible uses than we  describe here. For details on these capabilities, see  “Using Alternate Modulation” (☞p.51) and PG  p.151.

45,263.669,204.1087544,137.9392456,Velocity How hard you play the keyboard affects the expres- siveness of the sound. You can adjust the volume  level setting so that playing the keyboard softly will  produce a soft sound, and playing hard will pro- duce a loud sound. In addition, you can also adjust  the brightness of the sound and the envelope set- tings such as attack rate and release time. Using Velocity Switch in Combination Play mode  and Multi mode, you can play different Programs  by changing the keyboard velocity.  • See PROG 6: Ed–Amp1/2, Mod (☞p.55, PG

47,45.402,527.993522,67.140478,Damper Pedal (Sustain) The damper pedal is also sometimes called the  sustain pedal. It acts like the similarly-named  pedal on an acoustic piano; when you hold down  the pedal, notes will continue to sustain even  when you lift your hands off of the keyboard.
47,45.402,314.8943308,203.1256842,Damper Switch vs. Half-Damper You can use either a standard footswitch (such as  the Korg PS-1) or a special half-damper pedal  (such as the Korg DS-1H) as the Damper. If you use a footswitch, it will work like a normal  synthesizer sustain pedal: notes will sustain for- ever, as long as the pedal is held down. A half-damper pedal is a special type of continu- ous foot pedal (normal foot pedals won’t work  properly for this application). It offers more subtle  control of sustain, which can be especially useful  for piano sounds.  The X50 will automatically sense when a half- damper is connected to the rear-panel DAMPER  jack. For proper operation, you will also need to  calibrate the pedal, using the “Half Damper Cali- brate” command in the Global page menu. (☞PG  p.77)

To control these attributes, the X50 provides  “oscillator,” “ﬁlter,” and “amp (ampliﬁer)” sec- tions. The “oscillator” settings vary the pitch, the “ﬁlter”  settings modify the tone, and the “amp” settings  modify the volume.
51,45.402,220.660427,159.539573,The X50’s “oscillator,” “ﬁlter,” and “amp” On the X50, the settings that determine the “pitch”  are located in the PROG 1: Ed–Basic and PROG 2:  Ed–Pitch pages. In the Ed–Basic page you can  specify the waveform (multisample) and the basic  pitch of the waveform. In the Ed–Pitch page you  can specify how the pitch will follow the key- board, and make other pitch-related settings. “Filter” settings are made in the PROG 4: Ed– Filter1 and PROG 5: Ed–Filter2 pages. These set- tings adjust the tone. Finally, “Amp” settings are made in the PROG 6:  Ed–Amp1/2 pages. These settings adjust the vol- ume, and send the sound to the outputs.

51,263.669,369.346257,226.539743,EG, LFO, keyboard tracking, AMS,  Dmod, controllers In addition to the sections described above, the  X50 provides ways in which the sound can be var- ied according to time, key range, or various types  of performance expression. These are controlled  by modulators and controllers such as EG (enve- lope generator), LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator),  keyboard tracking, AMS (Alternate Modulation  Source), Dmod (Dynamic modulation), the  [PITCH] and [MOD] wheels. You can use these  modulators and controllers to apply change to the  basic sound of the program. Take a look at the diagram entitled “Program  structure and corresponding pages.” Notice that  the audio signal ﬂows in the order of Oscillator/ Pitch → Filter → Amp. Also notice how modula- tors such as EG and LFO can affect these blocks. As shown in ﬁgure, a program consists of OSC 1/ 2, effects, and the arpeggiator.
51,263.669,287.3467004,70.1392996,OSC 1/2 Each timbre consists of Oscillator/Pitch, Filter,  Amp, EG, and LFO blocks. You can create more  complex programs by using two oscillators  together in one program using the Layer feature. Note: The Pitch EG is shared by OSC1 and OSC2.
51,263.669,219.146476,56.340524,EFFECTS The output of OSC 1/2 is sent to the insert effect,  the master effects, and the master EQ. The mixer  section lets you control the routing, so you can  specify where the sound will be sent.

Normally you’ll set this to Poly, but Mono is use- ful when playing sounds such as synth basses,  synth leads, and other solo instruments. Another  important aspect of monophonic playing is Legato  triggering. When Legato is on (the box is checked),  if a new note on the keyboard is played before the  previous note is released, the ﬁlter and ampliﬁer  EGs will not re-trigger, so that you can move from  note to note in a true legato fashion. If the previ- ous note is released before the next note is played,  the note will trigger normally. Try switching between Poly and Mono, and listen  to the results.
53,45.402,337.868,13.212,Working with Multisamples
53,45.402,168.3041486,156.5398514,What is a multisample? A sample is a digital recording of a particular  instrument or waveform (or other natural or artiﬁ- cially processed sound) recorded at a speciﬁc  pitch. A multisample is a collection of similarly  voiced samples, used to create the same type of  sound - piano, bass, guitar, strings, organ - across  the entire keyboard, as the basis of a program. The  oscillators of single and double programs use mul- tisamples. There are 470 multisamples available in  this instrument. You can assign up to two multisamples to each  oscillator and switch between them by velocity.  This is called “velocity multisample switching.”
53,45.402,107.9048084,48.5391916,Multisamples and Drum Kits Multisamples and Drum Kits allow you to play  samples in different ways. • Multisamples lay out one or more samples
53,56.7398562,75.5046464,32.250528,across the keyboard. For instance, a very simple  guitar Multisample might have six samples– one for each string.
53,45.402,61.7048708,10.65042,• As the name suggests, Drum Kits are optimized
53,56.7398562,50.9048168,10.65042,for playing drum samples.

53,263.669,530.8468674,130.1381326,Selecting Multisamples If you specify a High and Low multisample for an  oscillator, either the High or the Low multisample  will sound depending on the velocity of the note  (i.e., the strength at which you play the keyboard).  This function is called velocity multisample  switching. Note: To make it easier for you to hear the result,  set the program type to “Oscillator Mode” Single. 1. Access the PROG 1: Ed–Basic, OSC1 page. 2. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to highlight

54,56.7391198,603.8457004,32.250528,Note: If you do not wish to use this function, set  the “Velocity SW L → H” value to 001. Only the  High multisample will sound.
54,56.74,524.791,67.195,Reverse check box Reverse lets you play the selected multisample  backwards, without looping. This can produce  interesting results for sound effects or other  unusual timbres. Normally you will not check  this.
54,56.74,440.6467544,72.3392456,Using oscillators 1 and 2 to create a  detuned sound You can use a double program (i.e., a program  whose “Oscillator Mode” is Double) to create a  detuned sound as follows. 1. Make the same multisample and EG settings,
54,68.0787364,394.4468168,46.0503036,etc. for OSC1 and OSC2. It will be convenient to use the Utility “Copy  Oscillator” to make the oscillator settings  match each other.
54,56.74,380.6470412,10.65042,2. Specify the playback pitch for OSC1 and OSC2.
54,68.0787364,258.8467256,118.65096,The playback pitch can be set independently.  By using the same multisample with slightly  different “Tune” settings, you can “detune” the  oscillators to produce a richer sound. Generally  speaking, people hear ﬂat notes as sounding  “sour” or out of tune more easily than they do  sharp notes. So when detuning two oscillators,  it may sound more musical to tune one  oscillator up in pitch, and leave the other  oscillator close to or just slightly below normal  pitch.

In this example, the multisamples will sound  over four levels. Velocity values 001–031: sound only the OSC1 Low multisample. Velocity values 032–063: sound only the OSC1 High multisample. Velocity values 064–095: sound the OSC1 High multisample and the  OSC2 Low multisample. Velocity values 096–127: sound the OSC1 High multisample and the  OSC2 High multisample.

A drum kit consists of multiple drum instru- ment samples placed across the keyboard. There  are 518 drum instrument samples. (☞p.48 “Multi- samples and Drum Kits”) In Global mode you can create or edit a drum kit  itself.

56,56.74,158.0558544,68.2841456,Using Alternate Modulation AMS (Alternate Modulation Source) refers to any  of the assignable modulation sources in X50,  including: • Built-in physical controllers, such as the
56,68.0787364,136.4557464,21.450474,[PITCH] wheel, [MOD] wheel, and Real-Time  Knobs
56,56.74,108.8561952,24.4501956,• Incoming MIDI controllers • Modulators such as the Filter, Pitch, and Amp
56,68.0787364,98.0561412,10.65042,EGs, or the LFOs
56,346.756,692.259,11.01,Using Alternate Modulation
56,275.0067148,522.2474064,138.4492986,Intensity is a parameter that sets the degree  (speed, depth, amount etc.) to which AMS will  control the modulation. A number of frequently-used modulation rout- ings, such as using the [PITCH] wheel to vary the  pitch, are provided as additional, dedicated rout- ings, separate from AMS. Note that not all AMS sources may be available for  some modulation destinations.  For details on alternate modulation and AMS, see  “Alternate Modulation Source (AMS)” (☞PG  p.151).
56,275.0071198,357.394044,146.975956,Suggestions on using AMS When making settings for alternate modulation,  think of the effect that you wish to produce, what  type of modulation will be necessary to produce  that effect, and what parameter of the oscillator,  ﬁlter, or ampliﬁer needs to be controlled.  Next, select a source (AMS) and set the Intensity.  If you proceed logically in this way, you will  achieve the desired effect. For example, if you want to control a guitar sound  so that it approaches feedback when you move the  [MOD] wheel, you might set up the [MOD] wheel  to modulate the ﬁlter frequency and resonance.
56,275.008,232.7085924,100.6844076,Controlling Pitch Here you can specify how the pitch of the multi- sample selected for the oscillator will change.  Pitch EG and LFO settings allow the pitch to var- ied over time. Note: To specify the basic pitch of the multisample,  use the “Octave” parameter in the PROG 1: Ed– Basic, OSC1 or OSC2 page.
56,275.008,61.6564764,153.1765236,Varying the pitch according to key- board position (Pitch Slope) On keyboard instruments such as piano or organ,  the pitch will rise as you play toward the right  side of the keyboard, and fall as you play toward  the left. You can use the “Pitch Slope” setting to specify  how this will occur. With positive (+) settings, the pitch will rise as you  play toward the right side of the keyboard. With  negative (–) settings, the pitch will fall as you play  toward the right side of the keyboard.  Normally you will leave this set to +1.0.

57,45.402,414.7551486,156.5399514,Pitch bend The PBend+ and PBend– settings specify the  amount of pitch change (in semitones) that will  occur when MIDI pitch bend messages are  received or when the [PITCH] wheel. A setting of  +12 allows the pitch to be controlled a maximum  of one octave upward; a setting of –12 allows the  pitch to be controlled a maximum of one octave  downward. “Ribbon (#16)” speciﬁes the amount of pitch  change (in units of a semitone) that will occur  when CC#16 is received (or when you operate the  ribbon controller of a connected TRITON Extreme  or similar device).
57,45.402,286.5557628,116.3392372,Portamento Portamento makes the pitch change smoothly  when you play the next note before releasing the  previous note. The “Time” parameter controls how long it take  the pitch to change. As this value is increased, the  pitch will change over a longer time. With a value  of 000, there will be no portamento. You can turn Portamento on and off via [SW1] or  [SW2], by assigning them to Porta.SW CC#65.
57,45.402,79.7565434,194.9394566,Creating Vibrato You can use an LFO to create vibrato. LFO 1/2 Intensity sets the depth to which the  selected LFO will affect the pitch. With a setting of  +12.00, vibrato will produce a maximum of ±1  octave of pitch change. “Mod. Whl. Int.” speciﬁes the depth of the vibrato  effect created by the LFO when you move the  [MOD] wheel or when CC#1 is received. “AMS Intensity” speciﬁes the depth of the vibrato  effect created by LFO when you operate an AMS  (Alternate Modulation Source). For example, sup- pose you set “LFO1 AMS” to KnobM1 [+] (Knob  Mod1: CC#17), and raise the “AMS Intensity.” If  Knob B Assign “Knob 1-B” is set to Knob Mod.1  (CC#17), vibrato will be applied when you turn  the X50’s knob [1] or when CC#17 is received.

57,263.669,500.8074726,91.7395274,Pitch EG When the Intensity value is set to +12.00, the pitch  EG speciﬁed in the Pitch EG page will produce a  maximum of ±1 octave of pitch change. To realistically simulate the slight change in pitch  that occurs when a string is plucked or at the  attack of a brass or vocal sound, you can use the  EG to create a subtle change in pitch at the attack.
57,263.669,295.0823646,122.2846354,Using Filters The ﬁlters allows you to diminish or emphasize  speciﬁed frequency areas of the sound. The tone of the sound will depend signiﬁcantly  on the ﬁlter settings. X50 provides Filter1 for OSC1 and Filter2 for  OSC2. For each of these ﬁlters, you can select from  two types (Low Pass Resonance or Low Pass &  High Pass). Filter2 can be used if “Mode (Oscilla- tor Mode)” is set to Double.

58,275.007595,593.0458892,67.6504116,At medium settings, the resonance will alter the  timbre of the ﬁlter, making it sound more nasal, or  more extreme. At very high settings, the resonance  can be heard as a separate, whistling pitch. To make the resonance track the keyboard pitch,  see “4–2a: Keyboard Track” (☞PG p.17).
58,275.008,511.5946346,63.5753654,Selecting a ﬁlter to modify the tone Here’s how to select a ﬁlter type and adjust the  “Frequency” (cutoff frequency) and “Resonance”  (resonance level). 1. Use “Type” to select a ﬁlter type.
58,286.3458562,451.5949214,56.8503576,Low Pass Resonance: This is a 24 dB/octave  low pass ﬁlter with resonance. Low Pass & High Pass: This is a 12 dB/octave  low pass ﬁlter and a 12 dB/octave high pass  ﬁlter connected in series.
58,275.008,437.7951458,10.65042,2. If you’ve selected Low Pass Resonance as the
58,286.3458562,323.7951626,113.8503492,ﬁlter type, you can set the parameters for Filter  A. “Frequency” speciﬁes the cutoff frequency.  Overtones above the speciﬁed cutoff frequency  will be diminished, making the tone more  mellow (darker). “Resonance” speciﬁes the resonance level. This  boosts the overtones in the region of the  speciﬁed “Frequency,” giving the sound a  distinctive character.
58,286.3458562,147.3573122,113.849469,If you’ve selected Low Pass & High Pass as the  ﬁlter type, you can use the Filter A parameters  to adjust the low pass ﬁlter and the Filter B  parameters to adjust the high pass ﬁlter. Overtones above the Filter A “Frequency” will  be diminished, making the sound more mellow  (darker). Overtones below the Filter B “Frequency” will  be diminished, decreasing the low-range and  making the sound thinner.

59,45.402,471.1944186,102.5395814,Keyboard Track Most acoustic instruments get brighter as you play  higher pitches. At its most basic, keyboard track- ing re-creates this effect by increasing the cutoff  frequency of a lowpass ﬁlter as you play higher on  the keyboard. Usually, some amount of key track- ing is necessary in order to make the timbre con- sistent across the entire range. • When Ramp “Low” is set to a positive (+)
59,56.738976,417.1941486,53.850636,value, the cutoff frequency will rise as you play  lower on the keyboard, making the sound  brighter. When set to a negative (–) value, the  cutoff frequency will fall as you play lower on  the keyboard, making the sound darker.

59,45.4002396,93.3955434,194.9394566,Filter EG The Filter EG is a multi-stage envelope, which you  can use to modulate the ﬁlter (naturally!) as well  as other Program parameters. The EG itself is set  up on the Filter page; the way that it affects the ﬁl- ters is controlled by the parameters described  below, on the Filter Mod page: The “Int. to A” and “Int. to B” settings control the  basic amount of EG modulation for ﬁlter frequen- cies A and B, respectively, before other modula- tion. The “Vel to A” and “Vel to B” settings let you use  velocity to scale the amount of EG modulation. The “AMS” setting selects a AMS modulation  source to scale the amount of the Filter EG applied  to Filters A and B. The two ﬁlters share a single  AMS source, with separate intensity settings.

60,56.74,63.17353,45.54047,Keyboard Track This lets you vary the volume relative to the note  you play. For more details, see “Keyboard Track” (☞p.54).
60,370.83,692.259,11.01,Using the Amp section
60,275.0071198,572.245314,88.739686,Velocity (Amp Modulation) Velocity Intensity is used by most programs to  decrease the volume of softly played notes and  increase the volume of strongly played notes. Normally you will set Amp Modulation to posi- tive (+) values. As this setting is increased, there  will be greater volume difference between softly  played and strongly played notes.
60,275.008,419.4469134,140.9390866,LFO1/2 Mod. Speciﬁes how the LFO’s will produce cyclic  changes in volume (tremolo effect). The volume will be affected by the LFO(s) for  which you set an LFO1 Mod Intensity, LFO2 Mod  Intensity value. Intensity (AMS Intensity) adjusts the depth by  which the tremolo effect produced by the LFO will  be affected when you assign an AMS (LFO1 AMS,  LFO2 AMS).  For example if you set “AMS” (LFO1 or LFO2) to  JS-Y #02, receive CC#2 to apply a tremolo effect.
60,275.008,362.594584,38.976416,Amp EG (Amp Envelope Generator) The Amp EG lets you control how the volume  changes over the course of a note.
60,275.008,224.5563388,75.4498638,Every instrument has its own characteristic vol- ume envelope. This is part of what gives each  instrument its identiﬁable character.  Conversely, by changing the volume contour–for  instance, applying a string-like Amp EG curve to  an organ multisample– you can produce interest- ing and unusual sounds.

61,45.402,422.955373,157.049685,The main “Pan” parameter determines the place- ment of the sound in the stereo ﬁeld after the sig- nal has passed through the oscillator, ﬁlter, and  amp.  Normally you’ll set this to C064, so that the sound  is centered equally between the left and right  speakers.  To create a stereo effect when “Oscillator Mode” is  set to Double, set the Amp1 “Pan” to L001, and  the Amp2 “Pan” R127. This will make OSC1 go to  the left speaker, and OSC2 go to the right speaker. With a setting of Random, the pan will change  randomly each time you play a note on X50, pro- ducing an interesting effect.
61,45.402,316.3558708,94.7391292,Pan AMS and Intensity “Intensity” speciﬁes the depth of the pan modula- tion from the selected AMS source. If you set AMS to Note Number, the pan will  change according to the keyboard position of each  note played. With a setting of LFO1 or 2, the sound will sweep  from side to side, creating an auto-pan effect.

68,275.008,373.0211402,99.5388598,Status This controls the status of MIDI and the internal  tone generator for each Timbre. Normally, if  you’re playing an internal Program, this should be  set to INT.  If the status is set to Off, EXT, or EX2, that internal  sounds will not be played. Off simply disables the  Timbre entirely. The EXT and EX2 settings allow  the Timbre to control an external MIDI device.
68,275.008,315.62153,45.53947,Bank Select (when status=EX2) When the Status is set to EX2, these parameters  allow you to transmit MIDI Bank Select messages  for changing banks on external MIDI devices.
68,275.008,193.421206,110.339794,MIDI Channel Timbres that you wish to play from X50’s key- board must be set to the global MIDI channel.  Your playing on the keyboard is transmitted on  the global MIDI channel, and will sound any tim- bre that matches this channel. Normally you will  set this to Gch. When this is set to Gch, the MIDI  channel of the timbre will always match the global  MIDI channel, even if you change the global MIDI  channel.
69,45.402,302.9559208,252.4492818,If a check box is checked, the corresponding MIDI  data can be sent and received. If “Status” is INT,  movements of the X50’s controllers or incoming  MIDI data will apply an effect for the program of  that timbre. (Effect Dynamic Modulation function- ality is not affected by these settings.) If the “Sta- tus” is EXT or EX2, movements of the X50’s  controllers will transmit MIDI data on the channel  of that timbre. MIDI transmit/receive settings for  the entire X50 are made in “MIDI Filter” (GLO- BAL 1). If a check box is unchecked, the corresponding  MIDI data will not be sent or received. As another example, let’s say that you’ve selected  a bass Program for Timbre 1, and a piano Program  for Timbre 2, with the goal of creating a bass/ piano split. You could make the following settings  so that pressing the damper pedal affects only  Timbre 2’s piano sound: 1. Access the COMBI 3: Ed–MIDI Filter1, -2 page. 2. Un-check the Damper CC#64 box for Timbre 1. 3. Check the Damper CC#64 box for Timbre 2.

69,263.669,526.3595384,128.4845616,Layers, Splits, and Velocity  switches Within a Combination, you can use note number  and velocity to determine which Timbres will  sound. The Programs assigned to each Timbre can sound  in three ways: as part of a layer, a split, or a veloc- ity switch. A Combination can be set to use any  one of these methods, or to use two or more of  these methods simultaneously.

70,56.74,348.4730788,10.65042,7. Set Timbres 2 and 3 to a Top Key of B3, and a
70,68.0787364,245.2740298,103.0502952,Bottom Key of C–1. You can also enter these values by selecting the  parameter, and then holding down the  [ENTER] button and playing a note on the  keyboard. The piano program will sound when you play a  key above or including C4. The brass program  and strings program will sound when you play  a key below C4.
70,56.74,68.3679754,108.5390246,Key Zone Slope In addition to “hard” splits, in which the sound  changes abruptly, you can use the “Slope” param- eters to gradually fade a sound in or out over a  range of keys. We’ll assume that you are continuing to edit from  the preceding example. 1. Access the COMBI 5: Ed–Key Zone, Key page. 2. In the example above, you could set the
70,68.0787364,35.9678134,32.250528,“Bottom Key” of timbre 1 to G3, and set the  “Top Key” of timbre 2 to G4, so that these two  timbres overlap.

72,56.74,373.3556514,43.050582,• If you wish to change the playback pitch of a  drum program, use “Detune.” If you change  the “Transpose” setting, the relationship  between notes and drum sounds will change.
72,56.7391198,272.755314,88.739686,Adjusting the BPM of multisamples If you’re using a phrase or rhythm loop multisam- ple in the program of a timbre, you can adjust its  BPM. You can use the utility menu “Detune BPM  Adjust” to call up a new BPM value. This changes  the BPM by adjusting the playback pitch.  For more details, see “Detune BPM Adjust” (☞PG  p.41).
72,56.74,191.5563562,69.3396438,Specifying the range of pitch change  controlled by the [PITCH] wheel This is speciﬁed by the “Bend Range.” You can  specify the range in semitone units. With the PRG  setting, the pitch bend range will be as speciﬁed  by the program.
72,275.008,441.155697,105.539303,Delay You can set some Timbres so that they don’t sound  immediately at note-on. This can create cool  effects, and more dramatic layers.  You can specify the delay for each Timbre either in  milliseconds (ms), or in rhythmic values which  sync to the system tempo. If you set the “Delay” to Key Off, the Timbre will  sound when the note is released.
72,275.0071198,362.155422,67.139578,Use Program’s Scale This speciﬁes the scale for each timbre. If you check “Use Program’s Scale,” the scale  speciﬁed by the program will be used. Timbres for  which this is not checked will use the Scale setting  “Type (Combi scale).”
72,275.008,234.5038168,109.7761832,Editing Programs with Tone Adjust Using Tone Adjust, you can make detailed edits to  Programs within the context of the Combi. You  can assign six parameters to each timbre and  adjust them, but you can also re-specify parame- ters and make further adjustments. Proceed as follows. 1. Of the COMBI 1: Ed–Tone Adjust, TA1–TA3  pages, access the page that you want to edit.
72,275.008,161.2658956,10.65042,2. For each timbre, use “Destination 1–6” to select
72,286.3458562,139.6657876,21.450474,the parameter that you want to adjust for the  program.

73,263.669,483.5078708,98.9751292,Insert Effect You can make settings for the insert effect in the  COMBI 8: Ed–InsertFX page. The output of each timbre can be sent to the insert  effect. You can use any type of effects, from distor- tions and compressors to choruses and reverbs. The Insert Effect can be routed to the main out- puts, or to any of the individual outputs. (☞p.84)
73,263.669,380.4556464,85.1763536,Master Effects You can make master effect settings in the COMBI  9: Ed–MasterFX page. There are two Master Effects, which are accessed  through Sends 1 and 2. These are best-suited to  effects such as reverbs and delays, but you can use  them with any type of effect. (☞p.85)

74,56.74,202.7270406,164.8500174,In Multi mode you will normally switch programs  and control the volume and pan etc. by sending  MIDI messages from your MIDI sequencer or  DAW software, but in this section of the manual  we’ll explain how to make these settings from the  X50 itself. However, making these settings in the  X50 does not automatically make these settings a  part of the sequence itself. These settings can be transferred to your MIDI  sequencer by sending a data dump from the X50  (if your MIDI sequencer can receive exclusive  messages) or by using the included “X50 Plug-In  Editor” software to read this data from the X50.  Then you can send these settings from your  sequencer back to the X50 when needed.

When you switch  multi sets on the X50, program changes and other  MIDI messages will not be transmitted even by  tracks whose “Status” is EXT or BTH. for Master: Choose this if you’re using the X50 as  a master keyboard. In this case when you switch  multi sets on the X50, program changes and other  MIDI messages will be transmitted from tracks  whose “Status” is EXT or BTH, allowing you to set  up your external sound module in this way.

82,56.74,509.9939242,146.9760758,Selecting a multi set You can switch multi sets via MIDI by sending  MIDI Song Select messages. A song select message  will be transmitted when you switch multi sets.  Conversely, you can switch multi sets by receiving  a song select message from the source you specify.  If the Global “Multi Mode” is set to “for Master,”  switching the multi set number will cause each  track with a “Status” of EXT, EX2 or BTH to trans- mit bank select, program change, volume, pan,  portamento, send 1 and 2, post-IFX pan, and post- IFX send 1 and 2 messages on the channel speci- ﬁed for that track.

82,56.74,214.1432194,175.6500714,The MIDI channel of a track is speciﬁed by MULTI  2: Track Param, MIDI “MIDI Channel.” When a  program change is received on a MIDI channel  that matches the channel setting of a track, the  program will change if the “Status” of that track is  INT. However, program changes for a track will  also depend on the “Program Change” setting. The “Status” setting is located in the MULTI 2:  Track Param, MIDI page, and the “Program  Change” setting is in the MULTI 3: MIDI Filter1, -1  page. If you’ve installed the included “X50 Plug-In Edi- tor” control plug-in into your DAW software, you  can conveniently select the X50 programs from a  list within your DAW.

Then the master effects can be used to  apply spatial-type effects such as reverb. The ste- reo 3-band master EQ located immediately before  the (MAIN OUTPUT) L/MONO and R outputs is  used to make ﬁnal adjustments in tone.

84,275.008,48.0662684,160.7767316,Filter and dynamics control effects Equalizers (07: St.Para.4EQ–08: St.Graphic7EQ)  divide the frequency range into several bands, and  allow you to boost or cut the level of each band.  Normally they are used to correct or compensate  the sound, but they can also be used to simulate  the frequency response that is typical of a particu- lar instrument (such as the resonances of a guitar  or string instrument). Compressors (02: St.Compressor) compress the  dynamic range of the input signal. Compression  makes the sound punchier and more consistent.  This is particularly effective on guitar, piano, or  drum sounds.

85,45.402,192.394879,293.375121,Pitch/phase modulation effects Chorus effects (16: St.Chorus–19: St.Ensemble, 26:  St.BiphaseMod) are an effective way to add spa- ciousness and thickness to any type of sound.  These are ideally suited for use with electric  pianos, strings, guitars, and so on. In an ensemble,  pitch variations between instruments create a rich,  slightly warbling sound. Essentially, this gives the  impression that a number of musicians are playing  together. The chorus effect simulates this. In stereo  performance, the stereo image is widened, thus  creating a magniﬁcent spatial ambience.  Flanger effects (20: St.Flanger–22: St.Env.Flanger)  add unique characteristics to a sound. Although  similar to chorus, a ﬂanger uses a shorter delay  time and feeds some of the output signal back into  the effect, creating a strong swell. Flangers work  very well on sounds that contain a lot of harmon- ics, as well as on distorted guitar sounds. Phasers (23: St.Phaser–25: St.Env.Phaser) cyclically  modulate the phase of the sound. They are similar  to the chorus and ﬂanger effects in that both use  modulation, but the manner in which the tonal  quality changes is different. They are effective  with electric piano, guitars, and synth sounds with  a reasonable sustain.
85,45.402,42.9434844,131.5766156,Other modulation and pitch shift  effects Rotary speaker effect (40: Rotary SP) simulates the  rotating speaker effect used in organs. It is ideal  for use with organ sounds, but it will also create a  unique effect with other sounds.  Pitch shifters (38: Pitch Shifter, 39: PitchShift Mod)  shift the pitch of the input signal. You can mix the  pitch-shifted sound with the original sound to cre- ate a chorus effect, or create special effects in  which the pitch continues to rise (or fall).

85,263.669,528.5943106,128.3756894,Early reﬂection and delay effects Early reﬂection effect (41: Early Reﬂect) produces  only the early reﬂections of a reverb effect. Using  just these early reﬂections, you can add weight or  spatial effects to a sound, such as reverberation.  Without the reverberation, you can achieve a clean  effect sound. Delays (43: LCR Delay–51: Sequence Dly) create  an echo effect by delaying the sound for a ﬁxed  length of time. You can also make the delayed  sound repeat (feed back).

85,263.669,212.3427622,225.5762378,Reverb effects Reverb (52: Rev Hall–57: Rev Brt. Room) is an effect  that creates the spacious reverberation of sounds  played in a hall or room. Reverb simulates the  sounds that are reﬂected from the ceiling and wall. When you hear music in a concert hall, the sound  from the instruments and voices reaches your ear  directly, but also reaches your ear after being  reﬂected off the ceiling and walls (and being  delayed by a corresponding length of time). In this  way, the direct sound (the “dry” sound) is joined  by numerous reﬂections that create the impression  of a large acoustical space. The way in which the  sound is reﬂected will depend on the materials of  the ceiling and walls, and also on the size and  shape of the hall. These factors also affect the way  in which the reverberation decays. Different effect  types let you simulate a broad range of reverbera- tion, and you can also edit the parameters to make  detailed changes to the character of the sound.

89,45.402,252.6705316,190.6486794,2. In “BUS Select,” specify where the output of  each timbre will be sent. (See diagram below) L/R: The output will be sent to (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO and R. Note: After passing through the master EQ, the  sound will be sent to (MAIN OUTPUT) L/ MONO and R. IFX: The output will be sent to insert effect IFX.  1, 2, 1/2: The output will be sent to  (INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT) 1 or 2. Note: It will not be sent to the insert effect, the  master effects, or the master EQ. Off: The sound will not be sent to (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO, R, (INDIVIDUAL  OUTPUT) 1 and 2.

The actual send level will be the send level of  each timbre multiplied by the send level of each  oscillator of the program selected for the  timbre. If the send level of a program is 0, the  actual level will be zero even if the send level  setting is raised here. If IFX is selected for “BUS Select,” set the send  levels to the master effects by adjusting the “S1  (Send1(MFX1))” and “S2 (Send2(MFX2))”  parameters (COMBI 8: Ed–InsertFX, Setup  page) located after the signal has passed  through the insert effect.

An asterisk “*” is shown at the right of Ch01–16  for the channel numbers of timbres that are routed  to IFX. If multiple timbres/tracks of different  MIDI channels are routed to IFX, set the “Control  Channel” to specify the channel you’ll use to con- trol the effect. For a combination, you will normally use the Gch  (global MIDI channel) to control the effect. For a multi set, you can use any MIDI channel that  is convenient. “All Rt.” stands for All Routed, indicating that  you can control the effect using the channel of any  timbre/track that is routed.

However, you also have the option of bypass- ing the insert effect or master effects for the entire  X50 if you don’t want to use them. For example, this can be useful when you’re using  an outboard effect such as reverb, chorus, or com- pressor to create an effect that you would other- wise create using the X50’s master effects, or when  you’re using a plug-in effect on your computer to  process the sound of the X50 together with other  sound sources. 1.

This applies to the entire X50 regardless  of the mode. For example, if you’ve connected the  X50’s outputs to an external mixer and are using  an external effect processor to apply reverb or cho- rus to the sound, you can turn off the X50’s master  effects.

These functions let you use the arpeg- giator to play a wide range of patterns including  drum or bass phrases, and guitar or keyboard  backing riffs. It is also effective to use the arpeg- giator as part of the sound-creating process when  creating subtly-moving pads, synth-sounds, or  sound effects. In Program mode you can use one arpeggiator. In Combination mode and Multi mode, the X50  features a Dual Polyphonic Arpeggiator that lets  you simultaneously use two arpeggio patterns.

Preset arpeggio patterns: There are ﬁve patterns;  UP, DOWN, ALT1, ALT2, and RANDOM. The operation of these patterns is ﬁxed, and can- not be edited. User arpeggio patterns: There are 251 patterns -  U000–U250 - which can develop chords or phrases  in a wide variety of ways, based on the pitches  that you play on the keyboard or the timing at  which you play them. In GLOBAL 5: Arp.Pattern you can modify these  user arpeggio patterns, or create a new user arpeg- gio pattern from an initialized condition. Edited  user arpeggio patterns can be written to internal  memory areas U000–U250.

You can verify this setting in the PROG 2: Ed– Pitch, OSC1 page. If “Oscillator Mode” is set to  Single, you’ll be able to specify two multisamples  and a velocity switch. If this is set to Double,  you’ll be able to make an additional set of settings  in the OSC2 page.
112,275.007595,564.3258644,53.8497558,If “Oscillator Mode” is set to “Drums,” you’ll be  able to make settings for one drum kit. A drum kit  does have velocity switch settings, but these set- tings are made for the drum kit in Global mode,  and cannot be edited or saved in Program mode.
112,275.008,523.81,16.515,Before you start editing…
112,275.008,340.588427,163.775573,First, select a Drum Program In Global Mode, you’ll play the kit that you’re  editing as if you were playing it from within the  Program, Combination, or Multi set which was  selected before you entered Global mode. So, before you enter the GLOBAL 4: DKit pages,  it’s best to select a Program which is already set up  for drums in Program mode, with the appropriate  EG settings, effects, and so on. Choose a drum  Program such as “A020: Standard Kit 3.” If you moved from Multi mode to Global mode,  playing the keyboard will sound the program and  arpeggiator of the track that matches the global  MIDI channel (GLOBAL 1).
112,275.0071198,223.5366464,99.1753536,Match the note mapping and key  position for the drum kit In order for the note mappings to match the key- board, the Oscillator’s Octave setting needs to be  +0 [8']. All Drum Kit Programs should have this  setting already. If you’re unsure, you can check  this yourself:  1. Access the Program mode PROG 1: Ed–Basic,
112,286.344976,212.7365924,10.65042,OSC1 page.
112,275.0071198,198.9368168,10.65042,2. Check that the “Octave” parameter (near the
112,286.3440958,152.7368792,46.0503036,top of the page) is set to +0 [8']. With a setting other than +0 [8'], the  relationship between the keys and the Drum  Kit sound map will be incorrect.
112,275.008,74.284576,60.576424,Check the memory protect setting When you wish to edit a user drum kit, ﬁrst turn  off memory protect by unchecking the Memory  Protect “Drum Kit” check box in the GLOBAL 0:  System Preference page.

This is the default. If “Assign” is not checked, the key won’t have  its own settings. Instead, it will use the same  settings as the next higher note–except that the  drum samples will be played at a lower pitch.  The pitch that sounds will depend on the  PROG 2: Ed–Pitch, OSC1 page “Pitch Slope”  setting. Use this setting when you want only to change  the pitch, such as with tom or cymbal sounds.

114,56.74,516.2473162,10.65042,6. Specify the Low Drumsample as you did in
114,68.0787364,459.2473246,56.8503576,steps 2–4. Now you have assigned drum samples to the  High Drumsample and Low Drumsample.  Next, we’ll assign the velocity range for these  drum samples.
114,56.74,445.447549,13.942368,7. Set the “Velocity SW L→H”.
114,68.0778562,271.4478526,170.8503408,The Low drum sample will sound when you  play a key less strongly than the speciﬁed  velocity value, and the High drum sample will  sound when you play more strongly. For example if you set “Velocity SW L→H” to  100, the drum sample assigned to “Low” will  sound when you play the keyboard softly, and  the multisample assigned to “High” will sound  when you play strongly. Note: If you don’t want to use this function, set  “Velocity SW L→H” to 001. Only the High  drum sample will sound. Note: This is the same type of function as  velocity multisample switching in a program.  (☞p.48)

114,275.008,476.194697,67.6495314,2. Use the Excl Group (Exclusive Groups) to make  one drum sound cut off another drum sound -  such as closed and open hi-hats. For example, let’s say that you’ve assigned an  open hi-hat and a closed hi-hat to the same  exclusive group:
114,275.008,434.7953702,38.2499712,• Play the open hi-hat sound. • While it’s still ringing, play the closed hi-hat. • The open hi-hat sound will be cut off–simulat-

114,275.008,285.5427628,120.5762372,Using Hold The Program Hold parameter can be especially  useful for drum programs, since it lets the samples  ring out naturally regardless of how long you hold  down the note. The way that this works depends  on settings in both the Program and the Drum Kit,  as described below. To enable Hold: 1. Access the PROG 1: Ed–Basic, Prog Basic page. 2. Voice Assign, make sure that the “Hold” check
114,286.3458562,228.5436514,56.8494774,box is checked. Once you’ve turned on “Hold” for the  Program, the function is controlled on a note- by-note basis according to settings within the  Drum Kit.

121,45.402,324.1087222,294.7742778,About the memory in Program, Com- bination, and Multi modes When you select a program, combination, or multi  set in PROG 0: Play, COMBI 0: Play, and MULTI 0:  Play, the data of the selected program, combina- tion, or multi set is called into the X50’s edit buffer. When you edit the parameters in pages such as 0:  Play, your editing will modify the data in the edit  buffer. If you wish to save this modiﬁed data into internal  memory, you must perform the Write operation. When you perform the Write operation, the data  in the edit buffer is written to the speciﬁed pro- gram number, combination number or Multi set  number of the speciﬁed bank. If you select another program, combination or  Multi set number without writing, the data of the  newly selected program, combination or multi set  number will be called into the edit buffer, and  your changes will be lost. When you press the [COMPARE] button in these  modes, the data in memory (i.e., the written con- tent) is temporarily called into the edit buffer. This  lets you compare the settings being edited with  the settings prior to editing.
121,145.547,293.8636,20.4864,Editing applies to the data in the edit  buffer. Programs or combinations will play  according to the data in the edit buffer.

If the [GLOBAL] button is lit or  dark, the X50 may be writing data that was  received from an external connected MIDI  device, or may be responding to a request for  output. If so, make sure that the X50 is not  writing data from an external connected MIDI  device or transmitting data in response to a  request, or that any such operation has been  completed. Then turn the power of the X50 off  and on again, and repeat this procedure from  step 1.
