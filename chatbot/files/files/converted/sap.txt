12,71.107953,563.24189775,42.73438675,A new employee can be hired without using Recruitment. Instead you can hire someone by running a personnel action in Personnel Administration, thereby creating the necessary data for the employee to be hired.
12,71.107953,526.44364975,27.24038775,Employee data must be kept current. After an employee is hired, circumstances can always arise which necessitate either the entry of new data or the correction of current data. For instance −
12,109.197368,501.91148375,11.74638875,An employee moves to his or her new address must be stored in the system.
12,109.197368,465.11323575,27.24038775,An employee gets a pay hike at the start of the year. The new salary must be stored for the relevant date.

12,109.197368,407.01073875,11.74638875,Data can be stored for the past, present, or future.
12,71.107953,382.47857275,12.93749,Note − Entering payroll-relevant data in the past triggers retroactive accounting.
12,71.107953,131.34666875,27.24038775,The HR module is comprised of major areas of functionality known as sub-modules. The HR module is a true demonstration of the strength of the SAP product in Enterprise Resource Planning.
12,71.107953,79.05442075,42.73438775,The HR system has very strong integration points (where data is passed back and forth without human intervention) with just about all of the other SAP modules. In addition, there is very tight integration amongst the HR sub-modules.

13,71.107953,437.41772275,27.24038775,This chapter throws light on the architecture of R/3 and explains how to install the SAP GUI on your system.
13,69.171203,408.986137687,18.637603079,SAP : Three-Tier Architecture
13,71.107953,369.88969875,27.24038775,With SAP R/3, SAP ushers in a new generation of enterprise software — from mainframe computing (client-server architecture) to the three-tier architecture of database, application, and user interface.
13,71.107953,129.73271075,12.93749,Three-Tier Architecture of SAP R/3
13,69.171203,88.45840775,31.860460482,Presentation Servers Presentation servers contain systems capable of providing a graphical interface.
14,107.260618,774.333229974,10.963295358,Presentation Layer is also known as client Layer
14,107.260618,755.611313974,10.963295358,Presentation Layer is a user interaction
14,107.260618,736.889397974,10.963295358,In SAP-User interaction purpose we use GUI
14,107.260618,718.167482974,10.963295358,GUI stands for Graphical user interface
14,107.260618,699.445566974,10.963295358,Example − Desktop, Mobile Devices, laptops
14,69.171203,589.40956175,31.860434482,Application Servers Application servers include specialized systems with multiple CPUs and a vast amount of RAM.
14,109.197368,564.87739575,11.74638875,Application Layer is also known as Kernel Layer and Basic Layer.
14,109.197368,543.57314775,11.74638875,SAP application programs are executed in Application Layer.
14,109.197368,506.77489875,27.24038875,Application Layer serves as a purpose of a communicator between Presentation and Database Layer.
14,109.197368,469.97665075,27.24038775,Application   server   is   where   the   dispatcher   distributes   the   work   load   to   the   different   work processes makes the job done.
14,69.171203,357.92491975,31.860408482,Database Servers Database servers contain specialized systems with fast and large hard-drives.
14,107.260618,333.959360974,10.963295358,Database layer stores the data
14,107.260618,315.237445974,10.963295358,Data store can be Business data, SAP system data, SAP tables, Programs.
14,107.260618,296.515529974,10.963295358,Examples − Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB/2, Siebel, Sybase, etc.
15,71.107953,610.26188175,12.93749,Three-Tier Architecture
15,69.171203,581.830322687,18.637603079,What is a Client?
15,71.107953,542.73388375,27.24038775,A client is a logical portion of an SAP R/3 physical database. From a business standpoint, a client can be interpreted as a logical group of companies.
15,69.171203,397.934805024,14.252284208,Points to Remember −
15,109.197368,358.14011375,27.24038875,All customizing (configuration) and development (ABAP) work in SAP R/3 is performed in a client.
15,109.197368,305.84786675,42.73438675,However,   the   data   from   both   customizing   and   development   work   may   be   stored   within   an individual client (client dependent data) or among all clients (client independent data) in the system.
15,69.171203,274.188364687,18.637603079,Client-Dependent vs. Client-Independent
15,71.107953,235.09192575,27.24038875,The data in each client may be separate from that of the other clients. There are basically two types of data in an SAP R/3 system − Client-dependent and Client-independent data.
15,109.197368,179.57176275,43.925488,Client-dependent data is defined as data specific to an individual client. Examples of client- dependent data include number ranges, ABAP variants, and user masters as well as the data that is created or updated through SAP R/3 transactions.
15,109.197368,127.27951475,43.925489,Client-independent data can be defined as data contained across all clients in the system. Examples   of   client-independent   data   include   data   dictionary   objects   (tables,   views),   ABAP source code, screens, and menus.
16,109.197368,555.86074375,58.22838675,Data   resides   in   tables.   To   determine   if   a   particular   table   is   client-dependent   or   client- independent, the table structure needs to be reviewed. The table structure can be viewed by the data dictionary (SE11). If MANDT (client in German) is the first key field of the table, then the table is client-dependent; otherwise, the table is client-independent.
16,109.197368,519.06249575,27.24038775,For   example,   the   TSTC   table   is   client-independent;   however,   the   USR01   table   is   client- dependent.
16,69.171203,487.402994687,18.637603079,SAP R/3 Delivered Clients
16,71.107953,448.30655575,27.24038775,Every SAP R/3 system contains the three clients 000, 001, and 066. Let’s review these clients and examine what they contain.
16,71.107953,427.00230675,11.74638875,These clients provide different features and must not be deleted.
16,109.197368,386.97616775,28.431463,Client 000 performs special functions. In particular, it is given extended functionality during upgrades.
16,109.197368,365.67191875,12.93749,Client 001 is basically a copy of 000 and can be used as a basis for a new customizing client.
16,109.197368,328.87367075,28.43149,Client 066 is a special client which is provided for operational system monitoring. It is used by SAP R/3’s Early Watch Service to provide performance recommendations.
16,71.107953,86.77993275,27.24038775,In releases prior to 3.0, client 000 contained a model company. As of Release 4.0 clients, 000 and 001 are identical. Client 000 no longer contains a model company. Either client can be used as the basis for
17,71.107953,758.27262375,27.24038775,configuration through a client copy. Typically, most projects start with a copy of client 000 to begin building configuration. Customer work should never take place in the three delivered clients.

34,69.171203,361.858556687,18.637603079,Reporting
34,71.107953,338.25611675,11.74638875,Report programs produce lists and can be divided into classical reports and interactive reports.
34,109.197368,298.22995175,28.43149,Classical   reports   do   not   allow   interaction   by   the   user;   therefore,   the   basic   list   contains extensive information that the user must often sort through to find relevant data.
34,109.197368,261.43170375,28.431489,Interactive reports allow interaction by the user; therefore, the user can produce secondary, detailed lists of the basic list by choosing the relevant data and requesting more information.
34,109.197368,178.15145775,74.913487,SAP Query or Ad-hoc Query or InfoSet Query is a tool that allows the end-user to design different queries based on different input and output parameters in the SAP system according to the requirement. This is one of the reporting tools majorly used in the HR Module to pull data from relational databases. InfoSet Query is suitable for reporting in all areas of the SAP R/3 system.
34,71.107953,153.61929275,11.74638875,Ad-Hoc query provides three different kinds of reports −
34,109.197368,129.08712675,12.93749,Basic List − Simple reports.
34,109.197368,107.78287775,12.93749,Statistics − Reports with statistical functions such as average, percentage, etc.
34,109.197368,86.47862875,12.93749,Ranked List − For analytical reports.
35,71.107953,773.76662275,11.74638875,Transaction code used to access ad-hoc Queries −
35,109.197368,749.23445675,12.93749,SQ01 − Maintain Queries
35,109.197368,727.93020875,12.93749,SQ02 − Display InfoSet

35,69.171203,674.966470687,18.637603079,Data Entry
35,71.107953,620.37603275,42.73438775,The SAP database has to be filled before the end-users can start working over the business process for analyzing and reporting purpose. Various methods are used to transfer data into the system at various stages depending upon the complexity and data volume to be transferred.
35,71.107953,583.57777175,27.24038775,Data can be transferred from SAP to SAP or SAP to non-SAP systems (legacy system). Data can also be transferred through manual entries. The tools used for data transfer are as follows −
35,107.260618,559.612212974,10.963295358,BDC (Batch Data Communication)
35,107.260618,540.890296974,10.963295358,IDOC (Intermediate Document)
35,107.260618,522.168381974,10.963295358,LSMW (Legacy System Migration Workbench)

35,107.260618,484.724549974,10.963295358,Manual data entry using transaction codes
35,69.171203,452.498467687,18.637603079,Printing
35,71.107953,397.90802975,42.73438675,SAP generates a variety of documents such as purchase orders, sales orders, invoices, pay-slips, etc. You can take a print of these documents whenever required. The following illustration shows how the printing process works in a SAP system.
35,71.107953,376.60375475,11.74638875,Different kinds of print methods are needed in a SAP system, such as −
35,107.260618,352.638195974,10.963295358,Local printing
35,107.260618,333.916279974,10.963295358,Remote printing (network)
35,107.260618,315.194364974,10.963295358,Front-end printing (SAP GUI for Windows)
35,107.260618,296.472448974,10.963295358,Front-end printing (SAP GUI for HTML)
36,71.107953,641.20685175,27.24038775,After the user triggers the print process, the print requests are sent to the spool server, which contains the dialog and spool work processes required for the processing.
36,69.171203,612.775279687,18.637603079,General Programming
36,71.107953,573.67882775,27.24038775,Programs can be written interactively using the capabilities of the R/3 system. Programs can be executed both online and in the background. Background jobs can also be scheduled to run at specific intervals.
36,109.197368,291.55892475,42.73438675,Module pool programming (or online programming) involves the creation of a module pool (a collection of ABAP modules) and one or more screens. The modules are called by the screen processor during program execution.
36,109.197368,239.26667675,42.73438775,Batch input processing is used to ensure the safe transfer of data into the SAP system. This process is an automatic, protected data transfer to the SAP system which uses SAP transactions to validate data as it populates the SAP database.
36,109.197368,202.46842875,27.24038875,ABAP   contains   statements   that   conform   to   CPI-C   standards   (Common   Program   Interface   - Communications). These are used for programming communications programs.
36,109.197368,181.16417975,11.74638875,ABAP can read and write sequential datasets.
36,71.107953,128.22634975,43.611948914,SAP - Security There are three points to look after in order to ensure security −
36,109.197368,103.69418375,12.93749,Confidentiality − Unauthorized disclosure of data
36,109.197368,82.38993475,12.93749,Integrity − Unauthorized modification of data
37,109.197368,773.76662275,12.93749,Availability − Denial of service (a lack of availability of computing resources)
37,71.107953,702.75245975,58.22838575,In SAP runtime environment, both application security and unauthorized system access to SAP have to be controlled. The user accounts defined for users in the SAP runtime environment are secured by roles that grant authorizations to them. SAP authorizations control access to transactions (Business Process Activities), or what can be performed within a specific business process step by −
37,107.260618,678.786900974,10.963295358,Keeping unauthorized persons out of the system
37,107.260618,660.064984974,10.963295358,Keeping people out of places where they should not be
37,107.260618,641.343069974,10.963295358,Safeguarding the data from damage or loss
37,69.171203,609.116960687,18.637603079,Safeguards
37,71.107953,570.02052175,27.24038875,In order to avoid threats, a sound and robust system implements safeguards such as access control, firewall, encryption, O/S hardening, digital certificate, security monitor, and antivirus.
37,69.171203,346.773457687,18.637603079,Classification of Security
37,71.107953,323.17101875,11.74638875,Security can be classified into three different categories −
37,107.260618,299.205459974,10.963295358,Organizational Security − Related to organization
37,107.260618,280.483543974,10.963295358,Physical − Related to the physical assets
37,107.260618,261.761628974,10.963295358,Technical − Related to technical threats. This is again dived into four types −

44,71.107953,432.18848675,27.24038875,In this chapter, we will understand the different phases of a SAP Project Lifecycle. A SAP project lifecycle consists of various stages, starting from evaluation to the project’s subsequent support.
44,69.171203,403.756928687,18.637603079,SAP Project Lifecycle
45,69.171203,766.639299687,18.637603079,Stages of SAP Project Lifecycle
45,71.107953,743.03685975,11.74638875,A typical SAP project undergoes the following stages in its lifecycle −
45,69.171203,686.26857075,47.354434482,Evaluation Evaluation may be a decision to choose between different software vendors or selection of products from a single vendor.
45,69.171203,614.00626975,62.848446482,Project Preparation Since a SAP implementation intends to map the organization processes to the ones defined by SAP, the implementation needs to have on-board people with complete knowledge of the organization business processes. The project preparation phase, amongst other things, aims to identify this team.
45,69.171203,557.23799375,47.354433482,Business Blueprint A business blueprint includes what modules of a SAP product would be used and the mapping of the existing business processes to the processes provided by SAP.
45,69.171203,484.97569275,62.848432482,Realization The actual work of customizing the SAP software to be in sync with the organizations business processes is done in this phase. It includes customization of existing SAP package and solution along with the development of new objects based on requirement.
45,69.171203,428.20738975,47.354460482,Testing The changes made in the realization phase need to be tested in isolation as well as in a consolidated manner using real-time data. This is done in the testing phase.
45,69.171203,355.94508875,62.848459482,Final Preparation The production system is prepared using the changes from the realization and testing phases. Certain activities need to be done directly in the production system as well. These activities take place during the final preparation phase.
45,69.171203,299.17683875,47.354407482,Go-live In this stage, the final product is released to the end-users. The go-live may be done in a Big Bang (all modules at one go) or in a phase-by-phase manner.
45,69.171203,214.383980948,75.378963284,Sustain / Support The project now moves into the “sustain and support” phase where the end-users’ issues would be resolved and ongoing maintenance of the system would be taken care of. SAP - Career In SAP
