Playing programs and combinations
Using controllers to modify the sound You can operate the X50’s [MOD] wheel, [PITCH] wheel, [SW1][SW2], and realtime controllers  to add expressive variation to your performances.
[PITCH] wheel, [MOD] wheel You can use the [PITCH] wheel and [MOD] wheel located at the upper left of the keyboard to  vary the pitch or adjust the depth of modulation. The actual result will depend on the program  and combination, but these controllers are normally used to apply the following effects.
Raise the pitch
Lower the pitch
Deepen the  vibrato
REALTIME CONTROLS [1], [2], [3], [4], [SELECT] Use the [SELECT] button to select realtime controller mode A/B/C, and use knobs [1]–[4] to  control the tone, effects, MIDI control changes, and arpeggiator etc. while you perform. Use  these knobs when you want to modify the sound while performing, or to make simple edits.

4. Turn knob [1] (LPF CUTOFF) to adjust the cutoff frequency of the low pass ﬁlter.
When you adjust the cutoff frequency of the ﬁlter, the brightness of the sound will change.  The effect will depend on the settings of the program parameters, but normally, rotating the  knob toward the left will darken the sound, and rotating it toward the right will brighten it. 5. Turn knob [2] (RESONANCE/HPF) to adjust the resonance level of a low pass ﬁlter or the
cutoff frequency of a high pass ﬁlter. The content that is controlled will depend on the ﬁlter type speciﬁed by the program. By adjusting the ﬁlter resonance level, you can increase or decrease the resonance level to add  a unique character to the sound. Adjusting the cutoff frequency of the high-pass ﬁlter will modify the thickness of the sound  from which the low frequency range has been ﬁltered out.

is applied). Rotating the knob will affect the depth of the ﬁlter EG. Normally, rotating the knob toward  the left will make the ﬁlter EG apply less deeply, and rotating it toward the right will make  the ﬁlter EG apply more deeply. Since the ﬁlter EG will operate based on the cutoff frequency  of the ﬁlter, knobs [1] and [3] will work together to control the tonal changes produced by the  ﬁlter.
7. Turn knob [4] (EG-RELEASE) to adjust EG release times of the ﬁlter and amp. This will
determine the time from note-off until the sound disappears. When you adjust the knob, the release times of the ﬁlter EG and the amp EG will change.  Normally, rotating the knob toward the left will shorten the release time, and rotating it  toward the right will lengthen the release time.

The HI (Hyper Integrated) synthesis system is a  PCM tone generator system with extensive modu- lation and effect routing capabilities, as well as full  digital signal processing that guarantees a rich,  pristine sound.
Tone generator section: • 64 MB of preset PCM ROM containing 470 mul-
tisamples and 518 drumsamples.
• The sampling frequency is 48 kHz, and the
maximum polyphony is 62 voices.
Filter/synthesis section: • 24 dB/oct Low Pass Resonance type or 12 dB/
oct Low Pass & High Pass type ﬁlters can be  used. A wide variety of ﬁlter effects can be  achieved, from active sounds with aggressive  resonance to subtle tones using a high pass ﬁl- ter.
• A broad range of editing parameters gives you
control over every aspect of the sound.
Effect section: • One insert effect (stereo-in/stereo-out), two  master effects (mono-in/stereo-out), and a  three-band master EQ (stereo-in/stereo-out)  can all be used simultaneously. You can select  from 89 types of effect algorithms, and edit  them.
• Highly ﬂexible effect routing is possible. Effects  can also be routed freely to the individual out- puts.
Alternate Modulation and Effect Dynamic  Modulation: • The synthesis section (ﬁlter etc.) provides Alter-
nate Modulation functionality, and the effect  section provides Effect Dynamic Modulation  functionality. This allows you to freely apply  modulation to parameters that affect the pitch,  ﬁlter, amp, EG, LFO, effects etc.
• LFO and delay time parameters can be syn-
chronized to MIDI clock/tempo. You can syn- chronize sounds or effects to the tempo of the  sequencer or the arpeggiator.
A great selection of 512 programs In the Program mode, the X50 provides 512 user  programs, plus 128 programs + 9 drum sets for  GM compatibility. When shipped from the factory, it is loaded with  high-quality programs that cover a wide range of  musical needs.
Programs using multisamples that pro- vide a broad range of sounds Based on 470 different multisamples that deliver a  broad range of sounds ranging from acoustic  instruments such as piano, guitar, and trumpet, to  synthesizer sounds or sound effects (oscillator),  the preset programs provide a rich variety of edit- able parameters (ﬁlter and amp), effects, and  arpeggiators.
Drum programs that support any style  of rhythm part Based on 40 user drum kits and nine GM2-com- patible ROM drum kits, and taking full advantage  of numerous editable parameters, effects, and  arpeggiators, the X50 provides a great selection of  preset programs for any style of music. The drum kits that are the basis of each drum pro- gram allow you to freely map any of the 518 drum  or percussion sounds to each note of the keyboard.  You can also create your own drum kits, and even  specify ﬁlter and amp settings, effect settings, and  individual audio output routings for each separate  key.

X50 Plug-In Editor supports editing  from within your DAW software The “X50 Editor” is a stand-alone program that  lets you edit the X50 from your Macintosh or Win- dows computer.  On the other hand, the “X50 Plug-In Editor” lets  you edit the X50 as a plug-in instrument from  within a host application such as DAW (Digital  Audio Workstation) software. It supports VST,  Audio Units, and RTAS formats. Both editors are  included with your X50.
Introduction
384 different combinations let you  freely combine programs The X50 provides 384 user combinations. The fac- tory settings contain a wide variety of Preloaded  combinations. A combination allows you to use layers, splits, or  velocity switching etc. to combine up to eight pro- grams together with the effects and the two arpeg- giators, in order to create complex sounds that  could not be produced by a program. You can also  create combis that include external tone genera- tors.
Effects that can creatively manipu- late the sound or generate subtle  ambience The X50’s effects can be used in many ways, rang- ing from manipulating the sound dramatically to  creating spacious reverberation. (☞p.9 “High- quality sound featuring the HI synthesis system”)
4 channel audio outputs In addition to the (MAIN OUTPUT) L/MONO  and R main stereo audio outputs, X50 provides  two individual audio outputs, for a total of four  channels of audio output. The sound from each  oscillator, drum, timbre/track, or insert effect can  be routed freely to any output.
Multi mode plays multiple tracks of  data from an external sequencer In Multi mode, the X50 can operate as a 16-track  MIDI multi-timbral sound module, receiving mul- tiple tracks of performance data from an external  sequencer or similar device. Since you can use the  effects and the two arpeggiators as well, the X50  will also function as a more advanced sound mod- ule. You can create, save and recall numerous Multi  sets in the X50 and it also supports GM (General  MIDI System Level 1), making it easy to use as a  sound module for a desktop music system.

About the X50’ modes The X50 has a wide range of capabilities; it lets  you play programs/combinations, edit them, play  the X50’s sound generator using musical perfor- mance data from an external MIDI sequencer, and  make settings that affect the entire X50, such as  transposition and tuning. The largest unit used to  organize these features is called a mode. The X50  has four modes.
Program mode Programs are the basic sounds of X50. In Program  mode, you can: • Select and play Programs • Edit Programs
Make detailed settings for oscillators, ﬁlters,  amps, EGs, LFOs, effects, arpeggiator, etc.
You can use the Tone Adjust function to make  simple edits for the program of a track. Assign Programs to each of the 16 MIDI Tracks,  each with separate volume, pan, EQ, and  keyboard and velocity zones; make settings for  effects, and two Arpeggiator (☞p.69)
Global mode Global mode lets you make overall settings for the  entire X50, and edit arpeggiators and drum kits.  For instance, you can: • Make settings that affect the entire X50, such as
master tune and global MIDI channel
• Create user drum kits, arpeggiators and user
scales
• Rename program, and combination categories • Set the function of the assignable pedals and
assignable switches
• Create drum programs using drum kits (as cre-
• Transmit MIDI System Exclusive data dumps
ated in Global mode)
• Play and control one Arpeggiator (☞p.43)
Combination mode Combinations are sets of up to 8 Programs that  can be played simultaneously, letting you create  sounds more complex than a single Program. In  Combination mode, you can: • Select and play Combinations • Use X50 as a 8-track multitimbral tone genera-
tor
• Edit Combinations
You can use the Tone Adjust function to make  simple edits for the program of a timbre. Assign Programs to each of the 8 Timbres, each  with separate volume, pan, EQ, and keyboard  and velocity zones; make settings for effects,  and Arpeggiator. (☞p.60)
• Control and play up to two Arpeggiator
Multi mode You can use the X50 as a 16-track multi-timbral  sound generator. The X50 will receive GM or other performance  data from an external MIDI sequencer, and play  back this data. • Select and playback Multi sets • Edit Multi sets

The page menu will appear. The page in which you were when you pressed  the [MENU/OK] button will be highlighted as  an indication.
2. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select the
page you want to view.
3. When you’ve made your selection, press the
center of the ClickPoint. You will jump to the selected page, and that  page will appear. As an example here, try selecting “Key Zone.”  The 5: Ed–Key Zone page will appear.
Note: The page that appears will be the page of the  tab you selected most recently. Note: If you set the Global mode setting “Page  Menu Style” to List, you can move by selecting  pages and tabs as shown in the following  illustration. (The display shown in step 2 is for  when “Page Menu Style” = Icon.)
Basic operations After you’ve powered-on the X50, here’s how to  perform basic operations such as selecting modes  and pages.
1. Selecting modes • In order to use a particular function on the X50,
you must ﬁrst select the appropriate mode. Press one of the front panel mode buttons to  enter the corresponding mode. [COMBI] button: Combination mode [PROG] button: Program mode [GLOBAL] button: Global mode [MULTI] button: Multi mode
2. Selecting pages Each mode has a large number of parameters,  which are grouped into pages. These are further  subdivided by tabs into up to eight tab pages. • Make sure that the desired mode is selected.
For details on selecting a mode, see “1.  Selecting modes,” above. In this explanation we’ll use Combination  mode as an example. Press the [COMBI] button.
Note: The COMBI 0: Play page will appear. (This is  shown in the upper left of the display.) In Combination, Program, or Multi modes (i.e., in  other than Global mode), you will normally  perform in this 0: Play page. You can also make  simple adjustments (edits) to the sound while  you’re in this page. To make more detailed  adjustments, use page 1 (COMBI 1: Ed–Tone  Adjust, etc.) and following.
Using the [MENU/OK] button +  [PAGE+][PAGE–] buttons to move • Hold down the [MENU/OK] button and press
the [PAGE+] ([PAGE–] button.
In Combination mode, you will move between  pages in the order of 0: Play ↔ 1: Ed–Tone Adjust  ↔ 2: Ed–Track Parameter ↔ 3: Ed–MIDI Filter1 ↔  ... etc. The page that appears will be the page of  the tab you selected most recently.

numeric buttons [0]–[9] to specify the page  number you want to view. The speciﬁed page number will appear. The  page that appears will be the page of the tab  you selected most recently.
[EXIT/CANCEL] button • You can press the [EXIT/CANCEL] button to
return to page 0 from any page.
Selecting tabs
[PAGE+][PAGE–] buttons You can press these buttons to move forward or  backward in steps of one tab. 1. Press the [PAGE+] button to access the page for
the next (right) tab. (Press [PAGE–] button to  access the page for the previous (left) tab.) This example shows the Combination page  through Prog page of COMBI 0: Play.
2. As you repeatedly press the [PAGE+] button or  [PAGE–] button, you will move consecutively  through the tabs. As you page up past the last  tab of a page, you will then move to the ﬁrst tab  of the next page. Likewise, as you page down  past the ﬁrst tab of a page, you will then move  to the last tab of the preceding page.
3. Selecting a parameter and editing  the value 1. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select the
parameter you want to edit. The value will be highlighted, and the  parameter name is displayed in the upper right  of the display. (We call this the “edit cell.”)
2. To modify the value of the edit cell, use one of
the VALUE controllers ([VALUE] dial,  [INC][DEC] button, numeric buttons [0]–[9], [–]  button, [./HOLD] button, [ENTER] button) or  the ClickPoint. For some parameters, you can use the PROG  BANK buttons to specify the bank of a program  etc. or to specify the parameter value. In some  cases you can also use the musical keyboard to
20
enter a note number or velocity value by  holding down the [ENTER] button and  pressing a note.
Note: You can use the [COMPARE] button to  compare the sound you’re editing with the  original unedited sound.
VALUE controllers
[VALUE] dial Use this dial to edit the selected parameter’s  value. This control is convenient when you want  to scroll through a very long list of selections.
[INC], [DEC] buttons These are used to increase or decrease the parame- ter value by individual steps. They’re convenient  for making ﬁne parameter adjustments.
In Multi mode when the cursor is located at the  track program (highlighted), these buttons switch  the program bank.
[COMPARE] button Use this when you wish to compare the edits you  have made to a program or combination’s sound  with the un-edited original (i.e., the sound that is  written into memory). When editing a program or combination, press  this switch. The LED will light, and the last-writ- ten settings for that program number or combina- tion number will be recalled. When you press the  [COMPARE] button once again, the LED will go  dark and you will return to the settings that you  were editing. If you edit the settings that are recalled by press- ing the [COMPARE] button (i.e., the settings that  are written into memory), the LED will go dark,  and it will not be possible to return to the previous  edits by pressing the [COMPARE] button again.
The Compare function is not available in  Global mode.
Basic operations
4. Selecting and executing a Utility  function
The utility functions provide commands that are  speciﬁc to each page, such Write (save) or Copy.  The available utility functions will depend on the  page you select. For example, the utility functions in Program  mode let you write (save) the settings, or let you  perform convenient editing operations such as  copying settings between oscillators or effects, or a  Sync function that lets you edit two EGs together. 1. Press the [UTILITY] button. The utility menu will appear.
2. Use the ClickPoint [π][†] to select a
command.
3. Press the ClickPoint center.

Note: By holding down the [ENTER] button  and pressing a numeric button [0]–[9] you can  access the dialog box for the ﬁrst ten utility  functions without going through the menu.
4. Use the ClickPoint [√][®][π][†] to select a
parameter in the dialog box.
5. To set the parameter value, use a VALUE
controller (☞p.12) such as the [VALUE] dial,  the ClickPoint (press the center and then use  [π][†]), or [INC][DEC] button. When  selecting a program or combination number in  a dialog box, you can also use the PROG  BANK/COMBI BANK buttons to enter the  bank as an alternative to using the VALUE  controllers.
6. To execute the utility command, press the
[MENU/OK] button. If you decide not to execute, press the [EXIT/ CANCEL] button. The [EXIT/CANCEL]  button is the same as “Cancel,” “Done,” or  “Exit.” The dialog box will close.
• If the utility menu is displayed, press the
[EXIT/CANCEL] button to close the menu.

After you’ve ﬁnished editing, be sure to write  (save) your changes. If you edit a program and then select a  different program or turn off the power, the  changes you made will be lost. The same is  true for a combination or multi set. The settings you edit in Global mode are  remembered as long as the power is on, but  will be lost when you turn off the power.
1. Lower the X50’s [VOLUME] slider.
Also turn the volume of your powered monitor  speakers or stereo amp down to zero.
2. Turn off the power of your powered monitor or
stereo amp.
3. Press the rear panel Power switch to turn off
the power.
Never turn off the power while data is being  written into internal memory. If the power is turned off while processing is  being performed, memory write operations  will not be completed correctly. If this occurs,  X50 will automatically initialize its internal  memory so that it will operate correctly. This  is not a malfunction. While data is being written, the display will  indicate “Now writing into internal memory.”  Data is written into internal memory by the  following operations.
• Writing (updating) a Program, Combination,  Multi, Global Setting, Drum Kit, or Arpeggio  Patterns
• Loading a Preload data for Program, Combina- tion, Multi, Global Setting, Drum Kit, or Arpeg- gio Patterns
• Receiving a MIDI data dump for Program,
If you playback X50 through your stereo  audio system, be aware that high volumes  may damage your speakers. Be careful not to  raise the volume excessively.
Connecting INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT 1 and 2 If desired, you can connect these two individual  (independent) outputs. They are unbalanced  phone output jacks. These jacks allow you to send the X50’s sounds to  external equipment independent of the (MAIN  OUTPUT) L/MONO and R jacks. This can be con- venient when recording, or when using a complex  live performance setup. 1. Connect the (INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT) 1 and 2
jacks to the input jacks of your mixer etc.
Note: The [VOLUME] slider does not affect the  volume of jacks 1 and 2.
Connections
Connections must be made with the power  turned off. Please be aware that careless  operation may damage your speaker system  or cause malfunctions.
Basic connections Connect the audio cables as shown in the connec- tion diagram below.
Connecting audio output devices Here, you can connect a set of ampliﬁed monitor  speakers or your audio system to output X50’s  sound.
Connecting the MAIN OUTPUT L/MONO  and R These are the main outputs. They are unbalanced  phone jacks. These are the main stereo outputs; their volume is  controlled by the [VOLUME] slider. All of the fac- tory Programs and Combis are programmed to  play through these outputs. If you’re editing a program or combination, or  playing back from an external MIDI sequencer in  Multi mode, you can set “BUS Select” to “L/R” so  that the sound will be sent from these jacks. 1.

Connecting a damper pedal This pedal can provide a damper effect as you  play. This instrument also supports half-damping.  Here’s how to connect an optional Korg DS-1H  damper pedal to the DAMPER jack and use it to  control the half-damper effect. 1. Connect an separately sold DS-1H damper
pedal to the DAMPER jack. You’ll be able to control the half-damper effect  if you’ve connected the DS-1H. If you’ve  connected a different switch-type pedal, it will  function as a damper switch.
2. After you turn on the power, set the switch
polarity and adjust the half-damper response to  ensure that the half-damper pedal works  correctly. (☞PG p.77, 80)
2. After turning the power on, use GLOBAL 0:
System, Foot page “Foot Pedal Assign” to  assign the function controlled by the foot pedal.  (☞p.88)
